the
life
expectancy   Nn
of
individuals
has   SVA
increased
due
to
better
accessibility
to
healthcare
services
and
facilities
than   Rloc-
before   Rloc-
.

in
addition
,
a
better
health
care
system
will
allow
the
people
to
stay
healthier
and
prevent
some
major
illness   WOinc
from   WOinc
happening   WOinc
like   WOinc
stroke
and
heart
attack
.

one
cause
for
this
is
attributed   Rloc-
to
the
era   Rloc-
of   Rloc-
baby
boomers
,
who
are
now   WOadv
mostly   WOadv
in
their
late
fifties
or
early
sixties
.

before
this
solution
was
implemented
,
they
did
a
further
study
,
and
realized
that
the
solution
will   Vt
not
work
;   Mec
as
the
farmers
are   Vt
using
traditional
farming
methods
which
are
not
yield
efficient
.

due   Wci
to   Wci
these
problems
,
a
team
of
researchers
have
created
a
system
that
makes   Rloc-
use   SVA
of   Prep
sensors
to
identify
human
actions
and
uses   Rloc-
mobile
devices
to
remind
the
elderly
to
perform
daily
activities
.

if
the
fertility
rate
continues
to
drop
,
there
will
be   Rloc-
not
-   V0
enough
young
people
to
replace
the
older
generation
.

some
people
argue
that
welfare
of
the
aged
is
a
full
responsibility
of
the   Prep
government
as
they
have
contributed
to
the
society
for
many
years
and
it
is
a
way
of
showing
appreciation
to
them
.

with
the   SVA
mission
'better
jobs
for
life
'
,
this
institute
is
to
provide
help
to
the
workforce
.

as   Wci
the
development
of
technology
,
the   Um
abilities   Um
of   Um
innovation
have   Vt
becoming   Vt
more
and
more
important
all
over
the
world
.

the
rewarding
of
the
elderly
does
not
push
the
country
forward
,
whereas
it
is
the
upbringing
of
our
youth
that
will
ensure
a   Wci
future
for
our
country
.

hence
,
the
individual
should
bear
in
mind
the
impacts
that
may
arise
and
decide
if
they   Pref
should
reveal
such
results
.

thus
in
the
next
few
paragraphs
,
i
will
explain
in
depth
on   Prep
the
various
research
and
government
policies
being
developed
has   Wci
help
to   Rloc-
ease
the
aging
process
.

we
are
not   Wci
only   Wci
concerning   Wci
the
shortage
of
technology
but
also
considering   Rloc-
the
danger
of
terrorists
.

besides
that
,
the
burden
to
take
care
of
the
graying
generation
will
also
be
shared
by
the
children
of
the
elderly
people
-   Srun
who
will   Vm
be
highly
educated
-   Others
to
find
jobs
easily
to
support
their
families
.

therefore
,
they
may
get
even
more
money
for   Prep
their
own
-   Trans
than
receiving
-   Spar
from
the   ArtOrDet
government
's   Npos
welfare
.

the
parties
involved
take   Vt
pride
in
their
work
.

the
safety
of
-   ArtOrDet
scwr
has
been
proven
and
can
be
better   Wform
in
the
future
.

thus
,
compulsory
saving
can
help
guarantee
a
sizable
amount
of
saving
for
their
future
and
is
a
practical
and
effective
way
to
ensure
old
age
dependency
is
-   Vt
kept
to
the
minimum
.

in
another
word
,
if
one
was
tagged
,
he
risked
being
permanently
marked
for   Nn
life   Nn
due
to
the
difficulty
of
removing
the
chip
.

yes
,
they
are
right
,
but
they
are
just
comparing
swcr
with
the   ArtOrDet
generation
iii
reactors
,
not
-   ArtOrDet
gfr
reactor
.

for
instance
,
if
our   Wtone
health
insurance
belongs
to
an
individual
for
earning   Um
purpose   Um
we   Wtone
should
pay
a
lot
more
to
see
a
doctor
and
get
a
prescription
and   Srun
this   Srun
makes   Wci
the   Wci
old   Wci
feel   Wci
difficult   Wci
as
they
can   Vm
not   Vm
earn   Vm
more   Vm
after
retirement
but
have
to
visit
hospital
more
frequently
than
before
as   Cit

fund
is
an
important
factor
that
determines
whether
the
design
process
can
be
carry   Vm
on   Wci
or   Rloc-
otherwise   Rloc-
.

in
recent
years
,
modifications
in
architectures
have
been
made
to
ensure
elders   ArtOrDet
'   ArtOrDet
safety   ArtOrDet
.

it
is
the
fact
that
sound
travels
through
matter
as
vibrations
.

therefore
,
we
can
say
that
limitation
on
spending
for
the
aged
is
a
good
idea
since
in
indonesia
,
there
is   SVA
still
many
areas
that
are
not
well
developed
yet
-   Mec
especially
in
-   ArtOrDet
economic
area
.

if   Um
a   Um
technology   Um
can   Um
not   Um
apply   Um
well   Um
enough   Um
,   Um
it   Um
can   Um
not   Um
develop   Um
.   Um

some
of
them   Pref
are   Wci
encouraging
later
retirement
,
raising   Um
more   Um
productive   Um
children   Um
,
encouraging
the
elderly
and
their
families
to
take
more
responsibility
for
their
health
,
etc
.

it
reduces
the
probability
of
making
mistakes
and
level
of
seriousness
of
accidents
.

on   Trans
the   Trans
contrary   Trans
,
people
often
question
the
effectiveness
of
these
initiatives
.

experiments
and
tests
are
not
to
be
omitted
in
laboratories
.   WOinc

besides
this
,
remote
controlled
lighting
helps
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
to
control
the
house
lights
with
a
remote
control
,   Srun
therefore
,
it   Rloc-
minimizes
the
risk
-   Wci
falling
in
the
dark
.

instead
of
treating
the
elderly
in
society
as
an   Wci
expense   Wci
,
the
government
can   Vm
think
of
ways
to
harness
the   Pref
knowledge
and
experience
from   Rloc-
them   Rloc-
so
that
they
can
contribute
back
more
into   Prep
society
.

therefore
,
the
elderly
have
to
rely
on
the
government
.

thirdly
,
engineering

of
electrical

chemical
,

with
rising

and
growing
concerns
of   SVA
global

,
countries
are
looking
to
nuclear
power
to
solve
the

aging
impacts
a
person
's
well
being
in
many
ways
,
with
both
psychological
and
physical
changes
,
including
chronic
diseases
associated
with
aging   Pref
.

besides   Trans
,
the
molten
salt
reactor
can
solve
these
problems
perfectly   Wci
.

studies
show
that
of
all   ArtOrDet
people
over
80
,
20
%
suffers   SVA
from
alzheimer
-   SVA
(
as
cited
in
health-cares.net
,
2005
)
.

in
addition
,
this
testing
also   WOadv
can   WOadv
be
used
to
determine
a
child
's
biological
father
or
a
person
's
ancestry
.

whilst
some
insisted
that
the
disclosure
of
the
results
is
necessary   Nn
because
it
leads
to
early
detection
of
a
disease
and
thus
enhances
preventability
and
treatability
.

this
is
influenced
by
the
different
social   WOadv
and   WOadv
economic   WOadv
atmospheres   WOadv
prevalent   WOadv
.

so
it
has
been
a
controversial
issue
that   Rloc-
whether
government   Nn
shall   Vm
cut
public
spending
on
the
aged
and
divert
-   Others
to
other
areas
of
economic
development
to
secure
stable
productivity

.

also
,
it
is
necessary
and   Prep
feasible
.

however
,
i
have
to
say
that
these
people
are
so
short-sighted   SVA
that
they
did
not
find
the
fundamental
solutions
.

apart
from
that
,
the
aged
is   SVA
also
burdened
by
the   ArtOrDet
inadequate
funds
in
their
cpf
accounts
with   Wci
several   Wci
reasons   Wci
for   Wci
the   Wci
inadequacy   Wci
.

these
are
very
complex
researches   Nn
that   Nn
could
take
a
long
period
of
time
and
requires
collaboration
with
partners
across
the
world
(
carre

2006
)
.

they
develop
certain
technology
which
satisfies
certain
consumer
domains
;
in
comparison
,
scientists
usually
do
not
know
the
use
and
the
specific
consumer
domains
when
they
first   Rloc-
accidently   Wform
discover
a
technology
.

the
second
consequence
is
about
the
genetic
discrimination
,
especially
in
employment
and
insurance
(
norrgard
,
2008
)
.insurance
may
not
be
provided
to
an   Prep
individual
with
results
showing
the
possibility
of
getting
ill
.

the
original
goal
of
developing
nuclear
technology
is   Vt
to
invent
weapons
.

it
is
still
remember
that   Wform
in
1979
at
three
mile
island
,
the
reactor
exploded
and
killed
31
at
once
and
spewed
radioactive
across
europe
.

it
is
hard
to
have
a   ArtOrDet
new
idea   Nn
pops   Rloc-
out   Rloc-
from   Rloc-
their   Rloc-
minds   Rloc-
as
they
will
not
think
out
of
the
box
.

the
military
aspect
has
contributed
a
lot
to
technology   Wform
improvements
.

nevertheless
,
some
may
argue
that
it
is   Rloc-
to   Rloc-
one
's
``
entitlement
''
to
receive   ArtOrDet
pension
-   Rloc-
and
other
forms
of
material
benefits
upon
retirement

.

the
government
have   SVA
also
been
legislating   Wci
laws
that
require
employers
to
offer
re-employment
to
their
workers
until
the
age
of
65.this
is
a
flexible
approach
because
the
workers
do
not
have
to
get
the
same
job
or
pay
.

once
knowing   WOinc
the   WOinc
reasons   WOinc
,
researchers
can
come
up
with
ideas
of
how
to
slow
down
or
even
reverse
the   ArtOrDet
aging
.

without
the
proper
understanding
,
people   WOinc
mostly   WOinc
-   Vm
object

engineering
design
,
let   Wci
alone   Wci
the   Wci
support   Wci
.

indeed
,
for
the
case
of
penicillin
,
fleming
did
not
anticipate
the
discovery
of
penicillin
,
a
type
of
antibiotics   Nn
,
when
he
was
making   Wci
researches   Wci
on
the
characteristics
of
bacteria
.

secondly
,
critics
argue
that
the
vhtr
is
too
costly
and
it
will
ultimately
be
eliminated
in
the
future
due
to
economic
factors
-   Mec
just
as   Wci
what
happened
to
the
htgr
or
high-temperature-gas-reactor
in
1989
(
international
atomic
energy
agency
,
n.d
)
.

this
is
due
to
the
nature
of
molten
fluoride
salts
,
which
is   SVA
used
as
coolant
and
is   SVA
mechanically
and
chemically
stable
at
sea-level
pressures
(
forsberg
2004
)
.

after
all
,
not
only
the
young
but
the
old
people
will
also
benefit
from
the
investment
on   Prep
education
.

however
,
singaporeans
still
enjoy
heavy
subsidies
in
public
hospital
,   Rloc-
especially   Rloc-
in   Rloc-
the
lower
class
wards
.

one
of
the
policies
is
the
housing
policy
,
which
strongly
encourages
extended
family   Nn
by
providing
incentives
and
also   Rloc-
to   Rloc-
provide   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
'elder-   Um
friendly   Um
housing   Um
'   Um
for
the   ArtOrDet
senior
citizens
.

so
,
the
grown
children
should   Vform
continue
with
such
tradition
.

one
of
the
core
theories
-   Others
is
to
teach
people
to
obey
the   ArtOrDet
rules
and
regulations
.

research
are   Vt
also   Vt
done
on
other
elderly   Rloc-
illnesses
to
find
out
the
most
efficient
medications
.

this
will
increase
the
willingness
of
the
grown
children
to
take
care
of
their   Prep
parents
and
realize
their
obligation
to
their
parents
.

we

we

as
there
will
be
a
lot
of
negative
impacts
to   Prep
the
country
-   Srun
such
as
-   ArtOrDet
inevitable
labor
shortage
,
increase
in
public
spending
and
healthcare
problems
if
the
ageing
population
continues
to
grow
disproportionately
with
the
country
's
fertility
rate
.

early
mobile
phones
were
heavy
,
bulky
and
expensive
with
very
-   Vt
low
coverage
.

many   Nn
of
the
researches   Nn
of   Prep
engineering
design
which   Rloc-
were   Rloc-
carried
out
in
the   ArtOrDet
modern
countries
had   Vt
been
done
successfully

(

)
furthermore
,
msr
's
fuel
doubles   Sfrag
up
as
its
coolant
due
to
the
good
heat
transportation
properties
of
molten
salts
further
reduce   SVA
on   Prep
the
waste
produced
.

the
emission
of
harmful
pollutants
into
the
air   Rloc-
atmosphere
by
motorcars
and
factories
has
affected
human
health
and
this
need   SVA
to
be
rectified
.

this
may
result
in
greater
productivity
among
the
workers
as
they
tend
to
be
more
committed
for   Prep
their
work
(
valarie   Cit
tan   Cit
,
2009
)
.

this
also
indicates
a
loss
in
mutual
trust
within
individuals
.

these
robots
can
also
play
a
role
in
taking
care
of
the
elderly
in
the
future   Trans
for
instance
-   Mec
the
wheelchairs
that
operates   SVA
using
buttons
can
replace
humans
pushing
the   Pref
wheelchair   Pref
.

although
governments
raise
fund   Nn
and
increase
budget   Nn
to
support
the
elderly
,
healthcare
costs
is
still
high
and
some
of
the
treatments
which
apply
new
technologies
and
methods
are
so
expensive
that
money
they
save
will
run
out
after
a
few
days
.

firstly
,
the   ArtOrDet
mobility
for
the
elderly
has
been
improved
.

for
example
,
a
factory
in
southeast
china
produces
toys   SVA
for
a
japanese
company
and
these
toys
are
sold
to
north
america
.

with
every
year
passes   Others
by
,
they
are   Vt
facing   Vt
the
limitations
of
their
physical
and
mental
strength
.

despite   Um
this   Um
,
the
crux
of
the
issue
here
lies
in
how
much
should   WOinc
this   WOinc
spending   WOinc
on   WOinc
the   WOinc
aged   WOinc
be
capped
at
.

this
is
because
different
people
will
react
differently
after
knowing
-   ArtOrDet
individuals
genetic
testing
results
.

as
a
result
,
the
lack
of
fund
will
hamper
the
progress
of
the
design
process
as   Trans
there
is   Vt
no
material
to
manufacture
a
physical
product
to
test
its
usefulness
.

throughout
the
years
,
there
has
always
been
a
debate
on
whether
technology
shapes
society
,
a
technologically
determinist
perspective
,
or
does   Rloc-
society
shape   SVA
technology
,
a
socially
determinist
view
.

spouses
too
have
the
rights   Nn
to
know
when
it
comes
to
making
a
family
just
as
he
or
she
has
equal
rights
over
the
children
.

other
than
that
,
engineers
will
also
need
to
go
through
the
process
of
``
analysing
-   Wci
and
selecting
a
solution
''
to
make
sure
that
the
new
product
is
fairly
accurate
and
it
will
not
cause
any
health
problem
to
the
user
before
releasing
it
to
the
market
.

it
has
changed
many
aspects
of
our
lives
and
has
unknowingly   Rloc-
-   WOadv
penetrated
ubiquitously   Rloc-
into   Rloc-
our
society
making
many
of
us
dependent
on
it
.

in
summary
,
vhtr
will
solve
the
nuclear
waste
problems
if
it
is
implemented
as
-   Wci
a
generation
iv
reactor
.

this
reduction
will
no
doubt
cripple
on
the
country
's
economy
,
as   Um
funds   Um
will   Um
have   Um
to   Um
be   Um

to   Um
cater   Um
to   Um
the   Um

in

,
the

,
a   ArtOrDet
american

company
-   Mec
was
funded
by

firstly
,
a
couple
who
is
planning
get   Vt
marry   Vt
and
one
of
them
or
a
close
relative
of   Rloc-
them   Rloc-
has
an
inherited
disease
-   Mec
is
advised
to
take
up
genetic
testing
.

however
,
-   ArtOrDet
public
is
very
concern   Wform
about
the
safe
operation
of
nuclear
reactors
.

in
order
to
make
engineering
design
product   Nn
meet
the   ArtOrDet
needs
,
first
of
all
,
-   ArtOrDet
clear
and
unambiguous
definition
of
this   ArtOrDet
problem
should
be
defined
.

their
focus
,
instead
,
is
directed
at
their
routine
occupational
job
and
their
own
family
matters
and
therefore
,
the
element
of
creative   Wform
is
not
part
of
their
daily
life
.

robbers
can
identify
rich
person   Nn
just
by
reading
the
rfid
tag
on
the
things
the
person
buys
.

therefore
the
solution
was
specified
and
the
design   Vt
process
was
nearing
completion
.

this
could   Rloc-
be
a
serious
security
flaw
;
in
case
the
plutonium
is
stolen
it
could
be
used
to
fuel
nuclear
weapons
.

in
addition
,
-   ArtOrDet
aging
population
has
not
been
an
area
of
concern
in
the
past
and
only
recently
the   WOinc
aged   WOinc
have   WOinc
formed
a
significant
population
in
developed
countries
.

a
lot
of
money
is
also
spent
on
developing   Vt
these
technologies
which
are
still
in
experimental
stage
.

it
is
well-known
that
the
world
is
facing
a
growing
aging
population
and
this
trend
is
unlikely
to
be
reserved
in
the
short
term
.   Trans

therefore
,
they
might
turn
to
counterfeit
product   Nn
that
may
even   WOadv
cause   WOadv
more
harm
to
their
body
.

also
,
msr
will
be
using
thorium
as
fuel
where   Wci
thorium
is
so
abundant
in
the
world
as
compare   Vt
to
current
technologies
which
mostly
use
coals   Nn
as
fuel
where
coals   Nn
are   SVA
expected
to
last
just
for
another
146years
according
to
energy
information
administration
(
eia
)
.

during
a
design
process
,
designers
do
not
focus
on
human
response
to
the
design
and
there
is
frequent
mismatch
between
the   ArtOrDet
operators
and
the   ArtOrDet
designed
machines
(
wilpert
,
2007
)
.

in
the
event
of
an
explosion
,
these
products
will
dissipate
into
the
surrounding
.

therefore
,
the   ArtOrDet
governments
are
funding
for   Prep
many   Nn
realistic
researches   Nn
and
technologies   Nn
to
weigh   Um
down   Um

notice   Wci
in
the   Wci
recent   Wci

diverting

be

for   Rloc-

,   Rloc-
the
projected
cost
of
building
a

is
around
$
1.1
billion
(

.

although
the
whole
process
of
making
the
car
is
very
tough
,
the
engineers
were
supported
by
company   Nn
,
government   ArtOrDet
,   ArtOrDet
and
society
all
the
way
.

it
is
so
important
that
innovation

should   Others
be   Others
existing
anywhere

therefore   Trans
,
coming
up
with
scrubbers
and
nitrogen
oxide
control
devices
that
are
more
cost   Wform
and   Trans
control
efficient
will
definitely
reduce
a
significant
amount
of
pollutants   Wform
emission
.

hopefully
,   ArtOrDet
the
engineering
design
processes
can
be
further
polished
in
a
short
term
so
as
to
return
engineering
designs
with
higher
quality
.

removing
individual
's
control
over
the
results
will
in
turn
lead
to
freely

genetic

causing   Ssub
social   Ssub
issues   Ssub

family
dilemma
.

giving
everyone
-   ArtOrDet
pension
means
that
some
people
's
living
standard
will
be
influenced   Wci
but
giving
out
money
based
on
the
fanatical
need
means
everyone
can
live
in
a
good
condition
.

in
conclusion
,
surveillance
technology
such
as
rfid
should
be
used
to
track
people
since
it
helps
-   Others
in
deterring
crimes
and
terrorism
,
monitoring

and
improving
welfare
of

with

currently   SVA

we

let
take
a
look
in

in

,
the
implementation

''
and
policies
to
create   ArtOrDet
age-friendly   ArtOrDet
environment
also   SVA
help
in
buffering
the
aging
process
.

even
if
the
elderly
can
support
themselves
,
some
may
argue
that
-   Ssub
they
pay
taxes
and   Ssub
should
be
allowed
to
use
these   ArtOrDet
funds
set
aside
for
them
.

different
countries
have
different
cases
that
can
not
be   Um
talked   Um
together   Um
.

one
current   Wci
human
need
that
should
be
given
priority
for
engineering
design
is
to
have
cost
saving
electronics
.

on
the
other
hand
,
for

innovation
process
,
the
researchers
had
successfully
developed
the
chair
for
the
convenience
of
the   ArtOrDet
deaf

in

.

therefore
,
if
the
government
are   Vform
about   Vform
to   Vform
limit   SVA
the   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on
the
aged
,
a
lot
of
-   ArtOrDet
young
and
elderly
will
suffer
.

from
fighting   Mec
for
independent

to
paving
the
way
for
our
generation
today
to
live
in

,
their
services
are
immeasurable

.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
development
of
society
calls
for
larger
and
larger
amount   Nn
of
energy
,
which
makes
us
in
desperate
need
of
energy
.

in
the
case
of

the

ones   Rloc-
who   Rloc-
stimulated
the

and
awareness
of
these

(
rogers

.

however
,
more
emphasis
should
be
placed
on
the
development

social
policy
helping   Ssub
to

address
concerns
such
as
the
lack

it   Ssub

in
my
opinion
,

input

in   Prep

stage
would
be   Vt
able
to
change
the
erroneous
part

the

electronics

become

human

we
are
going

the

thus
,
there
is
no
denying
the
fact
that
the

performance

is
a
convincing
illustration
for
limiting

military
priority
during

world
war
ii
was
an
important
factor
in
propelling
the
design
and
use
of

engine
.

this
two
tier
solution
would
definitely
help
in
the
progress
of
a
country
.   Nn

under
this
act
,
it   WOinc
prohibits   WOinc
employers   WOinc
from
making
unfavourable
employment
decisions
and
prohibits   WOinc
insurance   WOinc
companies   WOinc
from
reducing

coverage
.

the
extent
to   Wci
which   Wci
limitations   Wci
of
public
spending
on
the
aged
has
always
been
a
complicated
issue
in
many
developed
countries
.

this
has
resulted
in
very
different
products
-   V0
developed
by   Prep
each
environment
.

despite
the
above
said   Rloc-
,
it
may
be
objected   Wci
that
as
the
elderly
had   Vt
contributed
significantly
to
the
country
's
development
in
their
younger
days
,
in
view
of
their
long
term
hard
work
,
they
should
be
entitled
with   Prep
more
benefits
than
the
rest
of
the
population
.

therefore
,
emotional
reactions
of
relatives
or
parents
are
unpredicted   Wform
and
it
depends
on
the
believed   Wform
and
mindset
of
relatives
or
parents
of
individuals
.

even
for
the
same
kind
of
material
,
it
might
have
to
be
used
several
times
as
the
parts   Nn
fabricated
is
not
necessarily
always
in
the
expected
condition
when
it
is
first
made
,
resulting
in
a
wastage
and
hence
greater
consumption
of
raw
materials
and
therefore
a
greater
cost
incurred
in
the
designing
process
.

secondly
,
there
are
laws
such
as
-   ArtOrDet
genetic
information
non-discrimination
act
(
gina
)
or
the
health
insurance
portability
and

(

-   Mec
which
protect
the
confidentiality
and
interests
of
the
patient
.

the   Trans
engineers
produces   Wform
in
local
universities
are
not
able
to
fill
the
gap
left
by
the
engineers
who
leave
the
country
.

an
example
is
that
there
has
been
quite
a
number   Wci
research
on
the
kind
of
food
which   Rloc-
one
consumes
-   Others
will
help
to
slow   Wci
the
aging
process
.

at
the
same
time
,
more
and
more
facilities
are
designed
to
meet
the
needs
of
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
and
-   ArtOrDet
disability
.

in
other
words
,
-   ArtOrDet
world
's
ageing
population
has
the
potential
to
defuse
-   ArtOrDet
war
on
terrorism
.

some
older
workers
are
earning
minimal
wages
-   Srun
thus
they
have
to
take
a
second
job   Rloc-
or
part
time
job
to
boost
their
income
earning
.

a
phone
by
doro
with
big
buttons
and
limited
functions
is
an   Wci
example
.

nowadays   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
we
already
have
built
some
solar
powerhouses
but
we
never   Vt
hear   Vt
anything
unfortunate
happens   Vform
.

they
will
have   Wci
a
disbursement   Rloc-
of   Rloc-
grant
if
they
live
in
the

or
2

besides
,
such
costs   Wform
may
even
be
bigger   Wci
than
the
original
cost
of
running
welfare
programs
for
the
elderly
.

among
the
five
senses
,
the
most   Rloc-
common
deteriorations   Rloc-
of   Rloc-
senses   Rloc-
are
-   Ssub
vision
problems   Vt
and
hearing
loss   Rloc-
.

hence
,
the
idea
of
spying
people
by
using
technology
such   Wform
as
rfid
has
to
be
banned
.

one
such
example
is
the
healthcare
need   Nn
of
the
elderly
.

for
instance
-   Mec
free
personal
care
,
such
as
the
washing
and
dressing
of
elderly
people
costs
britain
an
additional
forty
million
pounds
which
caused
its
government
to
adopt
such   Um
policy.2   Um

while
it
is
important
to
care
for
the
aged
,
it
-   Srun
is
just
as
important
to
take
into
consideration
and
not
neglect
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

that
is
,
both
are
largely
successful
.

all
the
alternative
energy
-   Wci
mentioned
are
green
compared
to
the
burning
of
fossil
fuels
in
terms
of
emission
to
-   ArtOrDet
environment
.

the
two
main
causes
for
this
problem
are
population
outburst
and
corruption
.

in
north
korea
's
case
,
they
started
the
development
of
nuclear
technology
because
of
the
raise   Wci
of   Wci
tension
with
south
korea
.

basically
,
families
that
give
birth
to
more
than
one
child
will
get
economic
support
from
child   Wci
birth   Wci
rate   Wci
and   Wci
ease
the
ageing
process
.

this
brings
up
the
efficiency
of
the
reactor
by
as
much
as
50
-   Npos
percent
(
hecht
,
2008
)
.

in
fact
,
governments
should
only
focus
on
those
elderly
who   Spar
are   Spar
poor   Spar
,   Spar
needy   Spar
and   Spar
abandoned
by
family   Npos
.

hence
,
local
engineers
encounter
their
first
major
test
in
their
quest
:
limited
land
spaces   Nn
.

there
are
plans
to
scale
up
the
project
to
contribute
30
-   Mec
%
of
the
water
supply
by
2010
.

electric   Wform
generated
vehicle
will
not
exhaust
gases
when
it
is
being
driven
.

the
success
of
a
technology
not
only
depends
on
how
well
it
resolves
the
targeted
need
but
also
the
social
considerations
it
incurs
when
-   V0
introduced
to
the
consumer
market
.

for
example
,
when
the   ArtOrDet
families
have
an
average
of
one
child
instead
of
two
or
three
children
,
the
only   Wform
child
will
have
a   WOinc
very   WOinc
huge   WOinc
task   WOinc
and   WOinc
burden   WOinc
to   WOinc
take   WOinc
care
of
his
or
her
family
in
the
future
.

despite   Trans
the   Trans
concern   Trans
by   Trans
the   Trans
public   Trans
over   Trans
the   Trans
safe   Trans
operation   Trans
of   Trans
the   Trans
nuclear   Trans
reactors   Trans
being   Trans
built   Trans
,
there
is
strong
evidence
that
-   ArtOrDet
very-high-temperature
reactors   Nn
(
vhtr
)
,
one
of
the
six
generations   Nn
iv
nuclear
reactors
,
could
bring
positive
results
for   WOinc
further   WOinc
research   WOinc
and   WOinc

funding   WOinc
.

so
economy   Wform

became
a
big
concern
.

then
by

a
practical
solution
adopted
by
developed
countries
with
aging
societies
,
namely
,
singapore
,
-   ArtOrDet
usa
and
china
.

to
sum
up
,
the
generation
iv
reactors
is
a
trend
of
-   ArtOrDet
21st
century
,   Mec
it   Mec
will
make
a
great
improvement
and
progress
for
our
life
.

firstly
,
countries
can
help
to
ease
the
aging
process
by
implementing
-   ArtOrDet
new
policy
of
encouraging
elder   Wci
employment   Wci
.

hence
,
the
use
of
rfid   Wci
to
track
people
should
be
banned
.

however
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
as
the
people
should
be
self-reliant
.

a
series
of
experiments
show
that
graphite-based
materials
can
well
-   Mec
match
the
temperature
of
molten
salts
which
is
as
high
as
700
to
800
celsius
.

discrimination
in
employment
and   Vt
insurance
is
another
reason
why
an
individual
should
possess
the
right
of
disclosing
genetic
result
.

hence
,
in
the
long
run
,
it
is
more
economical
to
adopt
-   ArtOrDet
lead-coaled
fast
reactor
which
is
also
an
environmental   Others
source
of
energy
.

the
government
needs
to
know
how
to
set
limits
on
the
healthcare
budget
for
the
elderly
.   WOinc

secondly
,
petrol
resources
are
not
evenly
distributed
around
the
world
.

therefore
,
for
china
,
being
a
country
which
is
much
less
developed
than
japan
,
to
limit
the
spending
on
the
aged
will
be
a
more   Rloc-
wise   Wform
decision
.

not
only
that   Vm
this   Vm
would   Vm
pressurize
the
workforce
,
it
would
also
cause
them
to
spend
less
as
they
have
lesser
discretionary
income
.

as
a
result
,
once
everyone
is
deprived
of
deciding
to
keep   Rloc-
their   Rloc-
information
of
genetic
testing
unknown
,
people
who
are
tested
positive
would
be
discriminated
.

and
certainly
,
when
implemented
on
its
own
,
each
policy
presents
its
own
sets
of
problems
.

given
the
memories
of
previous
nuclear
reactor
accidents
,
the
public
concerns   Vform
a
lot
about
the
safety
of
nuclear
plants
.

nonetheless
,
the
advantages
generation
iv
nuclear
power
,
specifically
-   ArtOrDet
very-high-
temperature
reactor
(
vhtr
)
,
could
provide
can
offset
its
high
start
up
cost
and
overcome
its
disadvantages
.

if
the
former   Pref
need   Pref
is
put
forward
to
an
engineer
,
he
can
view
it
as
a
broad
topic
with
many
possible
solutions
.

the
main
reason
for
this
phenomenon
is
that
money
needs
to
be
spent
on
the
aged
now
so
as
to
ease
the
aging
process
-   Mec
if
not
-   Mec
years
down
the
road
,
public
spending
might
have
to
increase
significantly
as
compared
to
now
due
to
the
lack
of
progress   Rloc-
on   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
spending

for

,

with

were   SVA
done
to
show
that

because

as

that

sodium

because

the   ArtOrDet

this
is
extremely

as

stated
-   ArtOrDet
in
his
book
,
development

is
stimulated
either
by

or
by

thus
,
-   ArtOrDet

now
a   Wci
rising   Wci
problem
globally

therefore
,
japan
needs
to
ease

by
allowing
more

in
order
to
solve

the

until

the

instead   Um

hence
,
the

not
seem
to
be
a
problem
compared
with
the

and
the

the

moreover

the

solely

but

therefore

as

secondly

graying   ArtOrDet
population
has
created
pressure
for
-   ArtOrDet
younger
generation
as
the
ratio
of
young
adults
supporting
one
elderly
has
been
constantly
decreasing
.

thus
,
it
is
crucial
for
the
government
to
spend
more
public
fund   Wci
in
dealing
with
medical
problems
of
the
aged
.

all
these
steps
are
to
be
done
during
the
designing   Vt
stage
,
which
means
that
the
psychology
approach
will
play
an
important
role
.

nuclear
power
technology
is
much
more
well-rounded
and
practical
technology
when
compared
to
solar
power
or
bio-power
technology
.

for
example
,
a   Rloc-
small   Rloc-
device   Nn
called   Wci
hearing
aid   Nn
is   SVA
a
solution
for
the
hearing   WOinc
loss   WOinc
problem   WOinc
of   WOinc
the   WOinc
elderly   WOinc
.

he   Spar
does   Vm
n't
have
the
right
-   Others
to
disclose
it   Wci
.

the
advantages
of
the
nuclear
power
plant
are   Wci
more   Wci
than   Wci
the   Pref
disadvantages
.

in
order
to
combat
the
shrinking
workforce
,   Mec
caused
by
the
rapid
ageing
population
and
a
declining
fertility
rate
,
the
health
authorities
must
first
gear
up
their
medical
field
and
prepare
for
an
aging
population
.

fortunately
,
the
designers
of
-   ArtOrDet
laptop
were
strong-minded   Wci
so
people
nowadays
are
able
to
access
internet   ArtOrDet
anywhere
with
laptops
that
were
first
invented
by
them
.

as
a
result
,
governments
and
policy
makers
around
the
world
are
ready
to
set
aside
a
larger
portion
of
their
countries
'
budget
to
cater
for
age-related
spending
,
with
healthcare
for
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
as
most
of
their
top
priority   Nn
.

even
though
electric-powered
vehicles
were
relatively
more
superior
in
the
technicalities   Wci
,
due
to
the
factors
mentioned
above
,
the
technicalities   Wci
were
marginal   Um
and
people
were
not
affected   Wci
by
the
potential
problems
they
might
face
if
they
choose   Wci
the
gasoline-powered
vehicles
.

maybe
it
would
be
take
a
few
more
years
before
the
eco-car
have   SVA
a
potential
to
be
marketed

this
further
supports
the
need
for
research
and
development
on
molten
salt
reactor   Nn
.

the
developments
of
current
researches
,
especially
in
the
field
of
science
and
technology
have
benefitted
the
older
population
greatly
as   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
problems   Rloc-
faced   Rloc-
by   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
aging   Rloc-

are   Rloc-

in
conclusion
,
i   Wtone
strongly   Wtone
disagree   Wtone
in   Wtone
the   Wtone
usage   Wtone
of   Wtone
surveillance   Wtone
technology   Wtone
because
it
is
a
invasion
to
privacy
,
it
does
not
really
reduce
crime
rates
and
it
raises
a   Nn
problem   Nn
related
to
health
issues
.

the   Srun
first   Srun
step   Srun
is   Srun
to   Srun
identify   Srun
the   Srun
problem   Srun
,   Srun
which   Srun
usually   Srun
involves   Srun
the   Srun
process   Srun
of   Srun
knowing   Srun
what   Srun
the
customer
wants
and
what
problems
are
they
encountering
with
existing
products
.

in
the
21st
century
,
everything
develops
in   Wci
a
very
fast
pace
.

for
example
,
singapore   ArtOrDet
government   ArtOrDet
has
introduced
several
measures
to
boost
the
fertility
rate
.

take
the
aspect
of
electric
devices
as
an
example
,
-   ArtOrDet
refrigerator
was
studied
for
a
long
time
in
the
laboratory
after
people
had
the
desire
of
reserving   Wci
things
in
a
cold
temperature
longer
.

another
instance
could
be
the
upgrading
of
roads
to
cater
to
the
increasing
amount   Wci
of
vehicles
,
-   Ssub
to
reduce
road
congestion
.

since
the
disclosure   Cit
might
bring
negative
effects
to
the
individual
's
family
and
induce
discrimination
in
employment
as
well
as
the
purchase
of
insurance
,
i
would
like
to
agree
with
the
statement
of
having
right
to
decide
the
revealing
of
genetic
test
result
.

there
should
be
a
limitation
for   Prep
the   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on   Prep
the
aged
.

development
in
sports   SVA
such   SVA
as   SVA
hosting   SVA
the   SVA
youth
olympic
games
will
be
a
great
boost
to
the
tourism
sector
as
the
games
is
expected
to
generate
a
minimum
of
more
than
150,000
visitors
per
night
for
singapore
(
patwant
singh
,
2008
)
.

once
they
are
used
to
with   Prep
the   ArtOrDet
current
product
,
it
is
hard
to
persuade
them
to
switch
to
the   ArtOrDet
new
one
because
they
have
to
learn
how
to
use
the
new
device
.

furthermore
,
foreign
investors
will
not
set
up
factories
in
countries
that
are
equipped
with
-   ArtOrDet
poorly
educated
workforce
.

public
policies
assist
the
continuation
of
national
development
by
encouraging
education
,
research
and
development
,
and
-   Spar
introducing
the
latest
technologies
to
its
people
.

such
-   ArtOrDet
policy
can
give
securities   Wci
for   Prep
the
elderly
if
they
find
themselves
trapped
with   Prep
the
high
cost
of
healthcare
.

all
these
harmful
effects
bring
us
to
this
certain
human
need
that
should
be
given
the
utmost
priority
-   Mec
health
.

if
the
system
loses
control
,
its
core
temperature
will
rise
and   Wci
finally
it
melts
.

to
lengthen
working
lifespan
,
the
government
introduced
policies
to
reduce
elder
dependency
by
raising
eligibility
age   Wci
for   Wci
public
pensions
and
government
incentives
.

therefore
its   Wform
bias   Vt
to
say
that
surveillance
technology
threatens
one
's
privacy
to
a
huge
extent
.

as
a
result
,
now   Rloc-
their
citizens
are
able
to
enjoy
fresher
air
-   Srun
which
means
that
they
will
be
healthier
at
an   ArtOrDet
old
age
.

the
data
has   Vt
also   Vt
showed   Vt
that
stressful
working
life
is   Vt
contributing   Vt
to
the
poor
health
of
the
people
.

the
following
is
an
example
of
using
engineering
design
process
as
an
approach
to
solve
the   ArtOrDet
problem   Nn
.

motorola
8900
which
was
available
in
market
in
the
year
1995
was
firstly
featured
with
a
cover
so
that
miss-press   Wtone
of
button
was
avoided
.

grooming
then
,
comes
in
the
form
of
a
more
sophisticated
infrastructure
for
learning
and
monetary
incentives
or
aids
in
-   WOinc
scholarships
and
bursaries
.

there
are
some
products
which
directly
copy
the   Nn
design   Nn
of
foreign
companies
.

the
similarities
between
them
come
next   Rloc-
.

it
is
,   Rloc-
however   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
maybe   Rloc-
approached   Rloc-
from   Rloc-
another   Rloc-
angle   Rloc-
that   Rloc-
a
constant
proportion
of
-   ArtOrDet
gdp
of
a
country
to
support
the
old
people
is
maintained
.

the
culture
in   Wci
singapore
does
not
even
allow
our
workers
to
make
time
for
this
crucial
concept
generation
process
.

social
policies
,
practices
and
attitudes
discourage
working
at
an
older
age
because
the
retirement
for
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
will
be
costly
for
firms
.

however
,
the
policy
of
engineering
and
industry
can
not
meet
the   ArtOrDet
needs
.

these
examples
show
that
even
the   ArtOrDet
machine
errors
can
be
eliminated
by
carefully
design   Wform
and
applying
psychology
in
the
design
process
to
predict
all
the
cases   Wci
that
may
happen
in
the
future
.

thus
,
public   Wform
spending   Wform
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
and
the
money
should
be
diverted
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

the
engineers
keep
working
and
working
,
trial
and
error
,
wishing
to
invent
a
best
seller
and
have   Wci
a   Wci
good   Wci
benefit   Wci
.

the
poor
quality
of
products
hamper
the
interests
of
customers
and
yet   Rloc-
affect
the
fame   Wci
of
the
famous
company
.

another
major   Wform
difference
is
the
length
of
time
used
on
the
research
.

with
the
growing
population
and
various
problems
that
the
present
governments   Nn
face
today
,
the
governments
are
finding
it
tedious
to
balance
the
budget
to
ensure
that
all
areas
of
development
are
being
met
.

all
in
all
,
it
is
the
low
level
of
technological
base
and
the
lack
of
excellent
researchers
that
significantly
hamper
the
whole
process
for
innovation
.

nevertheless
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
ageing
population
is
likely
to
hurt
public
finances
,
it
is
crucial
to
recognize
the
well-being
and
livelihood
of
the
aged
can
not
be
compromise   Vm
by
investing
in
other
developments
for
economic
gains
.

it   Pref
can
bring
great
economic
benefit
.

as   Trans
such   Trans
,
i
agree
that
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
so
that
funds
can
be
diverted
to
other
areas
like
-   ArtOrDet
ministry
of
finance
,
education
,
health
and
national
development
.

besides
the
infrastructure
construction
,
another
advisable
method
to
increase
production
is
to
mechanize
the
agriculture   Wform
system
.

although
it
has
resulted
in
a
sounding   Wform
success
,
the
technology
has
not
been
widely
implemented
due
to
patents
of
the
technology
being
filed
by
the
parent
companies
.

henceforth   Trans
,
to
meet
the
world
's
energy
needs
,
scientists
are
re-addressing
the
potential
benefits
from   Prep
harnessing
power
through
nuclear
reaction
,
in
which
uranium
is
splitted   Vform
to
release
energy
.

the
accident
happened
in
1986
,
which
was
during
the
cold
war
(
1945-1991
)
.

thus
,
human   Nn
are
safe
from
the
radioactivity
produced
by
the
nuclear
waste
.

besides
,
moral
value
especially
to
make
the
children
beholden
to   Others
their   Others
parents   Others
can
be
inculcated
by
introducing
the
appropriate
modules
in
their
education
.

unfortunately
,
no
one
intends   Rloc-
to   Rloc-
pull   Vt
the
emergency
brake
during
the
emergency
condition
.

this
means
-   Others
the
time
and
money
required
to
do
the
research
for
sfr
is   SVA
much
less
than
that
of
swcr
.

so
when
some
original
designs
and
innovations   Wci
come
out
in
china
,
it
is
more
likely
for
them
to
be
ignored
and
discarded
.

from   Prep
the   Prep
article
``
doomsday
predications
about
population
aging   Cit
-   Wci
are
exaggerated
written
by
robert
b.friedland
and
laura
summer
''
,
it
stated
out
that
with
little
economic
growth
,
society
faces
fewer
choices
on
how
to
care
for
those
who
are
least
able
to
care
for
themselves
.

size
is
also
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered
because   Um
too   Um
heavy   Um
will   Um
not   Um
be   Um
appropriate   Um
to   Um
allow   Um
a   Um
patient   Um
to   Um
bring   Um
along   Um
to   Um
everywhere   Um
.   Um

also   Trans
,
the
amount
of
nuclear
waste
that
will
be
generated
is
greater
than
that
generated
by
the
lfr
(
oecd
nuclear
energy
agency
,
2009
)
.

this
would
cripple
the
economy
of
singapore
,
which
already   Vt
affected
by
the
aging   Rloc-
population   Rloc-
as   Rloc-
well   Rloc-
as   Rloc-
shrinking
workforce
,   Rloc-
further   Rloc-
as   Rloc-
more   Rloc-
money   Rloc-
will   Rloc-
be   Rloc-
spent   Rloc-
on   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
aged   Rloc-
at   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
expense   Rloc-
of   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
other   Rloc-
developments   Rloc-
of   Rloc-
singapore   Rloc-
.

for
some
elderly
person   Nn
,
public
spending
is
the
only
source
of
their   Rloc-
income
.

today
,
many
-   ArtOrDet
medicines
have
been
created
to
treat
cancers
or
other
health
problems
.

in
-   ArtOrDet
molten
salt
reactor
,
a
better
or
at
least
the
same
system
will
be
used
to
ensure
the
safety
of
the
reactor
.

since
the
scwr
safety
system
is
comparable
with
-   Spar
abwr
,
scientists
now   WOadv
are   WOadv
trying
to
combine
-   ArtOrDet
scwr
with
esbwr-type
passive
safety
systems
together   Rloc-
.

the
fact
that
it
may
cause   Wci
serious
troubles   Wtone
for
financial
resources
and
-   ArtOrDet
caring
from
young   Wform
generation
when
the
aging
population
changes
rapidly
urges
people
to
alter
the
way
they
support
themselves
.

the   ArtOrDet
safety   Mec
was   Vt
also   Vt
a
main
concern
in
this
technological
innovation
.

therefore
,
the
government
should
not
neglect
the
healthcare
benefits   ArtOrDet
for
the
aged
as
the
consequence
is
undesirable
.

also
,
the
new
alarm
system
and
window
grills
can
also
ensure
a   ArtOrDet
higher
level
of
security
in
their
area
.

actually
,
a

a
combination
of

multi-factorial   Others

such
as

occur
in

with

born
to

.

results
of
many   Nn
research
have
revealed
that
there
are
certain
components
which
help
to
maintain
a
healthy
cell
like
antioxidants
,
enzymes
,
hormones
or
``

(   Cit

...
.

also
,
the
design
has
biocompatible
properties
to
human
beings   Rloc-
tissues
,
because
the
intra-articular
longitudinal
fibers
allow
for

in   Prep
growth
.

thus
,
substantial
increases
in
economic
growth
would
be
needed
to
offset
the
increase   Wform
costs
of
aging
(
visco
,
2008
)
.

among
the
different
age
groups
,
the
elderly
population
is
at
the
highest
risk
for
adverse
events
-   Srun
such
as
falling
down
at

,   Rloc-
due   Rloc-
to   Rloc-
poor   Rloc-
health   Rloc-
and   Rloc-
chronic   Rloc-
conditions   Rloc-
.

it
is
quite
a
pity
to
limit
the   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on
the
elderly
regarding   Um
some   Um
of   Um
the   Um
disadvantages   Um
that   Um
are   Um
brought   Um
by   Um
such   Um
policy   Um
.   Um

those
who
are
more
affluent
might
migrate
causing   Ssub
a
loss
of
investors
and
talent   Nn
which   Srun
affects   Srun
the
country

.

then
,
another
question
rise   Wci
:   Wci
what
hamper   SVA
innovations
in
engineering
design
?

when
there
was
a
surge
of
power
,
they
tried
to
put
back
control
rods
,
hoped   Vt
that
-   ArtOrDet
power
level
could
be
lowered
.

the
social
policies   ArtOrDet
adopted
have
greatly
introduced
the
older
population
into
the
workforce
and
the
volunteering
sector
,
thus
keeping
them
actively
involved
in
the
community
and
easing
the
aging
process
to
a
large
extent
.

on
the
contrary
,
some
people
might
think
that
using   Nn
shielding
techniques
on
rfid
tags
is
already
an
effective
protection
mechanism
against
data
theft
and
data
corruption
(
syed
&
mohammad
,
2008
)
.

this
is
because
there
is
still
a
need
to
contribute
to
the
country
's
economic
growth
in   Rloc-
order   Rloc-
to   Rloc-
be   Rloc-
able   Rloc-
to
sustain
the
well-being
of
its
people
.

besides
that
,
it
is
also
important
for
the   Nn
relatives
to
have
psychological
preparation
earlier
so
that
they
are   Vm
managed   Vm
handle
their
stresses
during
the
period
of

whether

on

of
solving
the
present

.

for

,
personally

such
as

carrying
an

in
other
words
,
there
will
be
one
elderly
(
aged
above

)
found
in
every
five

.

according
to
khandani
(
2005
)
'engineering   SVA
design
process
'
is
a
sequence
of
steps
to
design
a
product
in
a
systematic
order
.

once
the
construction
cost
has
been
earned   Wci
back   Wci
,
the   Um
rest   Um
of   Um
the   Um
years   Um
would   Um
be   Um
a   Um
benefit   Um
to   Um
the   Um
consumers   Um
.

firstly
,
the
main
problem
of
aging
population
-   ArtOrDet
is
that
the
children
do
not
want
to
take
care
of
their
parents
when
they
are
old
,
because
they
think
that
parents
are
troubles
for
them
,
since
they
are
old
and
unable
to
contribute
.

according
to
the   ArtOrDet
friedland
and
summer
(
2005
)
,
if
a
nation
spend   SVA
more
on
the
aged
,
besides
slowing
down
the
growth
of
the
nation
,
it
will
also
create
more
costly
problems
in
future
.

another
challenge
that
the   ArtOrDet
innovators
need
to
be
concern   Wform
about
is
commercializing
the
finalize   Wform
products
.

some
of
the
facilities
provided
by
the
singapore
government   Mec
was   SVA
the   Rloc-
provision   Rloc-
of   Rloc-
park
connectors
more   Rloc-
facilities   Rloc-
near
working
industries
and
central
business
district
which   Srun
allows
working
people
to
enjoy
working
and
still
have
a
good
quality
of
life
.

rogers
,
e.m.
(
2003
-   ArtOrDet
)
.

such
an
approach
enables
engineers
to
think
out
of
the
bounder   Wci
and
challenge
the
old
conventions
,
and
subsequently
forges   SVA
innovative
breakthroughs
in
fields
,   Mec
like   Trans
transportation
system   Wform
-   Trans
construction
,
that
have
hardly
experienced
any
remarkable
advancement
for   Wci
decades
.

although
there
is
no   ArtOrDet
nuclear
incidence   Nn
happen   Vt
in
recent
years
,
it
is
too
biased
to
say
that
the
engineering
psychology
can
solved   Vt
the
problems
by
itself
.

the
government
should
divert
the
money
into
education
to
equip
the
people
with
the
right
attitude
and
working
skills
,
so
as
to
ensure
a   ArtOrDet
stable
economy   Wform
growth
for
the
country
.

for
instance
,
it
is
more
safe
now
for
patients
who
have
mental   Rloc-
lost   Rloc-
or   Rloc-
mental
diseases
if
they
are
lost
,
because
they
are
being
tracked
all
the
time
in
the
hospital
under
the
surveillance
system
like
rfid
.

there
have
been
many
proposed
strategies
,
policies
and
researches   Nn
that
acts   SVA
to
target
people
of
all
ages
in
alleviating
the
effects
of
a
greying
population
.

such   Wci
is
preferred
than   Wci
making
corrections
only
after
-   ArtOrDet
accident
-   V0
occurred
.

however
,
the
benefits
of
-   Pref
surveillance
should
not
be
downplayed
.

naturally
,
for
those
who
ca
n't
afford
it
-   Srun
,
we
should
extend
help
funded
by
public
generosity
.
''

the
maintenance
of
parents
act
is
one
good
example
of
government
intervention
to   Ssub
make   Ssub
taking
care
of
elderly
mandatory   V0
when   Rloc-
necessary   Rloc-
.

singapore
is
presently
building
an
education
hub
in
asia
,
investing
millions
of
funds
to
boost
her
image
and
economy
.

therefore
,
they
would
rather
hire
a
-   ArtOrDet
worker
with
higher
qualifications
,
who
is
more
competent
,
and
most
importantly
,
younger
.

if
[
individuals
]
do
n't
have
adequate
coverage
-   Mec
,
there
will
be
a
tremendous
strain
on
subsidized
care
which
will
drain
revenues
from
the
state
.

though
activities
held
by
the
above
organizations
ranged
from
learning
history
,   Um
stance   Um
to
acquiring
leadership
,
not
many
students
were   Vform
benefited
from
them
.

this
essay
will
examine
three
major
factors
in
the
development
of

mobile
telecommunication
in
different
stages
.

the
second
step
in
the
design
process
is
the
gathering
of   Pform
information   Pform
.

if
he
chose
to
give
safety
the
most
priority
,
he
would
have
pulled
the
emergency
brake
and
the
accident
could
probably
be   Vt
prevented
.

one
such
method
is
increased
focus
on

such

will
only
discourage

thus

in

the

the

most

claim

the
length
of

history
is
almost
one
hundred

since

though   Rloc-

still

as
the
world

energy
demand
is
on
the
rise
,
the
world
-   ArtOrDet
has
to
look
into
alternatives
to
solve
this
issue
.

this
is   Nn
because
the
emotional
stability
of
the
relatives
in
question
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration
,
as
not
every
person
in
the
family
would
develop
the
disease
even
if
there
have
a
particular
mutation
that
puts
them
at
a
higher
risk
of
developing
the
disease

other
than
that
,
the
elderly
must
also
play
their
part
by
creating
more
awareness
to   Wci
the   Wci
society
and
participating
actively
in

in

countries
,
the

of

another
component   Nn
is
copper

for
example
,

how

the

in
conclusion
,
current

the

tried
to

the
reason
that

second
,
in
contrast
with
the
benefit
which   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
fuel
injection
has
contributed
to
humans   Wci
'   Wci
life
,
it
has
-   Trans
polluted
the

copper

good
electrical
conductivity
which
allows

with
this
additional
economic
revenue
generated
by   Um
the   Um

more
public

can
be
channeled

majority
of
these

the   ArtOrDet
baby

yearn   Vt
to
extend

although
some
argue
that
rfid
technology
that
stores
one   Wtone

information
in
rfid
such
as

provides
great

it
creates

at

another   Rloc-
alarming   Rloc-
fact   Rloc-
is   Rloc-
that   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
even   Mec
singapore

also   Vm

research
by
kloosterman
(

shows

the

to
cure

such
as
cystic

,
a

in
such
small
nations
(
in
terms

like
singapore
,
this

physical
health
of

in
conclusion
,
public

be
limited
so   Rloc-
as   Rloc-
to
prevent   Vt
incurring   Rloc-
heavy

the   Rloc-
'welfare

undermine

one
of
which   Pref
is
to
increase
public
spending
so
as
to
ensure
that
the

are
taken
care
-   Wci
.

without
the
awareness
of
recognizing
or
discovering
the   ArtOrDet
problems
,
the
innovation
process
can
not
proceed
smoothly
.

as
a
result
,
heated

be
disposed

immediately
without

threatening
an

catastrophic
incidents
always
take

a
series
of
mistakes
to
happen
where
human
errors
usually
play
a
main
part
(

however

there
are

a

with

various
factors
have
contributed
to
allow
such

invention
to
be
widely
adopted
in
today
's

one
considerable
implication
of

is
its
possible
impact
on
the
country

future
macro-economic
performance
(

therefore

such
unfavourable
factors   Wci
continue
to
place
the

public
support

from
the
all
the
reasons
mention   Vt
above
,
it
is
very
clear
that
cutting
down
public
spending
for
the
old
age
is
not
a
good
choice
in
order
to
divert
the
money
for
the
areas

indeed
,
the
utmost
purpose
for

to

in
conclusion
,
through
the
various
available
health
polices

,
the

able

and
if
this
problem
persists
,
it
will
gradually
become
a
roadblock
for
the
future
advancement
of

society

therefore
,
i
conclude
that
although
current
research

development/policies   Trans
have
helped
to
ease
the

a
large
extent

but   WOinc
they

not
managed

applications

the

all
the

per

this
shows
that
an
elderly

is
never
a
useless
person
in
the
society
.

self-employed
people
do
not
have
cpf
as
they

so

one

according

us
national

this
shows

in

thus

a

consideration

thought

else   Rloc-
it
can
cause

however

many

it

one

that
is
why

to

medical

contend
that

psychological
effects
such
as
fear
,
anxiety
and
depression
,
affecting   Ssub
their
lifestyle
(
yap

)
.

for
example
,
it   Pform
can
not
only
look
up
words
in
chinese
and
english
as
the
old
one   Nn
does   Vt
,
but
also
many
other
languages
,   Mec
like
japanese
and
franch   Mec
as
well
.

one
example
is
the
introduction
of   Vt
unmanned   Vt
combat
air
vehicles
by
the
engineers
in
the
military
.

as
a
consequence
,
a
huge
lost   Wform
was
caused
to
the
whole
industry
.

as
the
pace
of
society
quickens
,   WOadv
people   WOadv
around
the
world
are
faced
with
an
increasing
number
of
problems
.

it
should
be
evident
that
the
very-high-temperature
reactor
is
the
best
among
the
6   Wci
evolutionary
concepts
of
generation
4
reactors
.

however
,
the
use
of
rfid
can
have
undesirable
effects
on
our
body
because
radio
waves
from
rfid
are
mutagenic
and
it   Spar
is   Spar
harmful
when
exposed   Others
in
large
quantity   Nn
.

as
the
saying
goes
``
prevention
is
better
than
cure
''
-
free
health
screening
and
health
campaigns
should
be
implemented
-   ArtOrDet
.

from
primary
schools
to
junior
colleges
,
lecturers
are
always
rushing
through
lessons
in
order   SVA
to
be
able
to
finish
the
syllabus
on
time
.

as
such
,
it
is
logical
that
we
support
the   ArtOrDet
research
of   Prep
swcr
.

for
example
,
there   Wform
are
customized
to
contain
various
elderly
friendly
features
such
as
the
alarm
system
that
automatically
request   SVA
for

through
a
pull
of
a
lever
in
case
of
-   ArtOrDet
emergency
.

singapore
is
currently
a
develop   Vform
country
.

to
conclude
,
although
some
technical
issues
of
-   ArtOrDet
super
critical
water
reactor
are
still
under   Vform
researching   Vform
,
personally   Rloc-
i
reckon
that
the
scwr
would
be
the
most
promising
reactor
against
other
generation
-   Others
ones
,
in
terms
of
performance
,
cost
,
feasibility
,
and
impacts   Nn
to   Prep
the
environment
.

one
of
the
many
reasons
given
to
support
the
claim
for
scwr
funding
is
that
-   ArtOrDet
scwr
is
the   ArtOrDet
combination
of
two
proven
technologies
-   Mec
which
are
light
water
moderated
reactors
(
lwrs
)
and
supercritical-water
fossil
plants
(
buoniorno
,
2002
)
.

since
there
are
foundations
for
the
benefit
of
the
hearing
impaired
,
one
step
that
could
be
taken
is
to
unite
these
institutes
with   Trans
the
developers
of
this
technology
-   Wci
to
make   Rloc-
ensure
the   Wci
research
continues
.

after
which
they
will
be
treated
and
purified
by
various
sub-processes
such
as
reverse
osmosis   Vt
,
distillation
,
chemical
disinfection
and
some
others
.

in
addition
,
this
technology
also
complements
the
work
of
security
personnel
and
thus
provides
added
protection
against
sneaky   Wtone
terrorist
attacks
.

firstly
,
some
older
workers
have
weak
command
of
english
or
are
english
illiterate   Nn
as
they
are
school
dropouts
.

workers   Trans
can
still
have
medical
check   Nn
regularly
to
ensure
they
are
healthy
as
health
problems
would
n't
come
in   Wci
a
sudden
,   Srun
it   Pref
must   Wci
accumulate
over
time
.

funding
and
incentives
were
given
to
companies
to
improve
automobile
technology
as
whichever
countries
with
the
more
advance   Wform
technologies
have   Vt
a
higher
chance
of
winning
the
war
.

the
most
doubtful
question
still
appears
in
public
is
about
the
safety   ArtOrDet
design
as
well
as
security
solution
to
against
any
attempt
of
terrorists
or
saboteurs
.

to
summarize
,
government
encourage   SVA
later
retirement
in
order
to
reduce
elderly
dependency
and
implement
social
policy   Nn
such
as
subsidy
on
housing
medical
fee   Nn
.

second   Trans
,
although
the
land
required
to
build
the
scwr
is
less
than
-   Spar
the
existing
reactors
,
the
area
needed
to
build
-   ArtOrDet
new
scwr
would
be
better
utilized
as
area
for
agriculture
-   Others
especially
in
the
future
.

they
realize
the
first
problem
comes   Vt
up   Vt
now   Vt
is
-   Pref
we
need
a
revolution
in
medical
procedures
.

finally
is
the
entrepreneurship
process
where
innovations
are
punch   Vform
into
the
new
market
.

however
,
if
this
trend
of
spending
has   Vt
been   Vt
continuing   Vt
in
the
future
time   Rloc-
,
it
will
be
destructive
to
a
country
's
financial
structure
.

with
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
returning
to
the
workforce
,
they
are   Vt
less
dependent
on
the
government
subsidies
and
thus
,
less
funds
should
be
set
aside
for
the
elderly
.

the
possibilities
are
endless
,
but   Vt
it
proves
one
point
.

it
will
be
burdensome
to
china
's
next
generation
,
especially
the
tax
payers
,
-   ArtOrDet
if
the
expenditures
on
medical
and
welfare
programs
are
not
held
in
check
.

however
,

that

in
conclusion
,
sfr
stands
as
a
more
viable
option
to
be
the

to
the

's

crisis
.

so
for
the
country
's
development
-   Srun
there
should
be
more
injections
than
the   ArtOrDet
leakages
.

this
satisfy   SVA
the
need
as
electricity
can
be
generated
from
renewable
sources
of
energies   Nn
like
solar
and
wind
energy
.

-   ArtOrDet
workfare
scheme
is   Vt
also   Vt
been
implemented
recently
to
cater
to
the
aging
process
,
especially
for
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
who
are
less
educated
that   Ssub
results
in
low-income   Vt
level   Vt
.

another
example   Rloc-
about   Rloc-
public
spending
on
medical
subsidies
for
the
aged
is
the
elderly
,
who
represented
about
7
per
cent
of
the
south
korean
population
,
accounted
for
17.7
per
cent
of
total
national
health
insurance
(
nhi
)
expenditures
in
2001
(
yoon
and
hendricks
,
2006
)
.

they
say
that
related
department   Nn
have
to
spend
too
much
money
on
the   ArtOrDet
plants
and
the   Nn
revenue   Nn
can
not
cover
the
cost
.

in
countries
such
as
united   ArtOrDet
kingdom
,
welfare
system   Nn
and
pension
scheme   Nn
are
in
place
.

social
work
aims
at
restructuring
the   ArtOrDet
society
,
such
that
a
more
balanced
society
is
attained
,
where
no
single
citizen
becomes
the
victim
of
the   ArtOrDet
economics   Wform
development
.

we
can
conclude
that
sfr
is
also
cost   Wci
saving   Wci
.

the
current
generation
of
elderly
is
most
probably
the
first
batch
to
learn
about
the
cpf
in
1955
,
and
being
a
young
scheme
then
,
there
is
a
high
chance
that
they
-   V0
unable
to
fully
benefit
from
it
.

on
the
other
hand
,
it
is
fortunate
that
the
singapore
central
provident
fund
(
cpf
)
,
which
is
the
fundamental
pillar
of
our
social
security
framework
for
the
old-aged   Rloc-
,
lend   SVA
itself
readily
to
provide
citizens   Rloc-
for
the
needs
of
aging
population
.

the
senior
activity
centre
also
provides
a
place
for
the
lonely
old
folks   Wtone
to
mingle
around
and
to
participate
in
recreational
activity   Nn
.

the   ArtOrDet
spending   Mec
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
so
that
the
money
can
be
diverted
to
other
sectors
of
the
country
's
development
-   Srun
like
public
transportation
or
the
army
.

but   Wtone
,   Wtone
the   Wtone
aging   Wtone
problem   Wtone
may   Wtone
be   Wtone
exaggerated
,
due
to
a
variety
of
reasons
.

it
is
now
widespread
and
ranging
from
testing
the
congenital
defect
of
a
foetus
to
finding
the
existence
of   ArtOrDet
the
oncogene
.

there
were
no
occupational
hazard   Nn
influenced
by
the
decisiveness
and
attitude
of
the
project
managers
.

therefore
,
innovations
that
were
created
in
a
skunkwork
environment
are
usually   ArtOrDet
created
faster
than
those
inventions
created
by
conventional
research
.

for
example
,
on   Prep
july
2007
,
c3m
and
local
university
,   Mec
uni
sim
offered
courses
to
senior
citizens
so
as
to
enable
them
to
earn
credits
through
courses
and   Wci
pursue
a
degree
in
future
.

critics
also
argue   Wci
over   ArtOrDet
efficiency
problems
of
the
vhtr
.

in
some
sense
,
innovation
helps
humankind
to
move
forward   Wci
.

this
is
vital
as
the
speed
at
which
information
is
communicated
can
determine
if
the
mission
will
succeed   Wform
.

although
there
are
regulations
to
prevent
insurers
from
discriminating
people
with
a
higher
chance
of
getting
certain
genetic
diseases
-   Cit
the
changes
in
health
care
financing
and
organization
(
hcfo
)
,
2005
)
,
it
might
lead
to
higher
insurance
premium   Nn
for
everyone
.

hard
work
finally
pays
off
.

global
warming
has
been
linked
to
the
more
frequent
occurrence
of
natural   Srun
disasters
.

overall
,
the

have
done
well
in   Rloc-
helped   Rloc-
to
ease

aging
process
in   Wform
a
large

with
the

it
was

by
associate

while
not

the
benefits
it
brings
,
the
ethical
and
moral
issues
regarding

far

the

.

thus
,
to
deal
with
such
challenges
,
researches   Nn
-   Others
and
developments   Nn
or   Trans
policies
have
been
brought   Wci
out   Wci
to

hence
the

compared

these

have
many

many   Wci
useful

even
though
conventionally

is
more
popular   Pref
nowadays
,
both
ways
of
production
have
its
own
advantages
and
disadvantages
.

the   Rloc-
rights   Rloc-
and   Rloc-
wrongs   Rloc-
on   Rloc-
using   Rloc-
surveillance   Mec
technology
on
the
public
has   SVA
been
an
issue
for
a
long
time
.

all
these
are
called
genetic
discrimination
.

since
the
lead
user
has
such
a
great
need
on   Prep
a
product
that
could
help

keep

-   ArtOrDet

first
commercially
introduced
to
long
distance
food
transportation
in
1900s
(
bowden
&
offer
,
1994
)
.

consequently
,
-   ArtOrDet
public
claims
that
nuclear
power
wastes
create
a
high
degree
of
proliferation
risks
and
until
today
there
is
no

it

this
effort
should
be
continued
without   Rloc-
fail   Rloc-
as
this
would
guarantee
the
living
standard
of
the
old   Rloc-

firstly

senior

we

otherwise
we
lose

more

this
aid
enables
medical

in
fact
,
the

could
even
produce
50
%
more

compared
with
other

in
general
,
three
aspects   Wform
can   Trans
be   Trans
innovated   Trans
:   Vt
they   Vt
are
improving
the
effectiveness
of

the   Wci

,   Trans

for

there
must
be
some
reasons   Nn
.

many

starting
to
express
interests   Nn
in
this
new
nuclear
technology
and
some
even   Vt
form   Vt
a

to

research
on

most

former

announcement   Wci
of   Wci

,
although
it
was
given
up
at

end
.

supporters
of
lfr
claim
that
lfr
is
much
safer
than
vhtr
.

nowadays
electronic
information
from
consumers
is
``   Wci
collected
,
compiled
and
sold
''
(
consumer
watchdog
,
2009
)
without
reasonable
safeguards
and
therefore
poses
a
threat
to
the
exposure
of
private
matters
of
consumers
that
may
lead
to
abuse
of
such
information
for
certain
benefits
or
intentions
.

hence
,
this
-   Vform
caused
singaporeans
who
were   Vform
not
as
proficient
to
become
unemployed
.

during   WOinc
newater   WOinc
's   WOinc
history   WOinc
,
-   ArtOrDet
government
,
-   Others
resources
and
the
development
of
other
technology   Nn
show   Wci
a
significant
influence
on
the
development
of
newater
.

hence
,
they   Mec
will
rely
heavily
on
the
government
subsidies
.

(

with
the
goal
of
minimizing
the
impact
of
the   ArtOrDet
problems
associated
with
an
ageing
population
.

after
conducting
a
root
cause
analysis
on
the
accident
,
a
psychologist
could
perhaps
aid   Vt
the
company
by
vetting
the
flawed
regulations
to
grant
train
conductors
the
power
to
make
an
assessment
to
stop
the
train
should
he   Pref
receive
any
complaints
from
passengers
.

apart
from
the
demands
from
business
and
education
,
other
factors
have
also
shaped
the
development
of
virtual
technology
and
solutions
have
been
designed
to
meet
the   ArtOrDet
needs
.

according
to
butler
,
the
global   Wform
demand
for
energy
is
expected
to
double
by
2050
(
nature,2004
)
.

there
are
a
group
of
people
who
might
strongly
feel
that
if
proper
research
had   Vt
been
done
,
the
engineers
-   ArtOrDet
would
have
come
up
with
a
better
design
such
that
any
faulty   Wform
in
the
wheels
would
have
-   Vform
detected
and
hence
preventing   Vform
the

from
moving
.

(

.this
is
done
when
singaporeans
reach
the
age
of
55
,
part
of
their

savings
will
be
transferred
into
an
annuity
which
will
provide
a
steady
stream
of
income
from
the
age
of
65
for
life.cpf   Mec
is
a
mandatory
saving
scheme
and
therefore
it
ensures
that
the
elderly
will
have
the
financial
means
to
support
their
aging
process
.

however
in
some
cases
where
unfilial   WOinc
children   WOinc
comes   WOinc
in   WOinc
,
the
government
has
introduced
the
``
parents
maintenance
act
law
''
,
to
help
solve
the
problem
of
unfilial
children
by
making
them
support
their
elderly
parents
in
a
form
of
paying
them
a
monthly
allowance
.

in
the
society
,
there
is
still
a
fraction
who
remain
jobless
or
whose
job   Nn
do
not
have   Wci
a
steady
contribution
to
the
cpf
.

by   Prep
the
same
time
,
the
online
banking
system
also
facilitates
the
procedure
to
make

however
,
these
problems
could
be
solved
by

chinese

however
,
with
efforts

education
,
i
optimistically
believe
that
we
can
overcome
these
obstacles
to
be
competitive

in

global
market
.

in
contrast
,
penicillin
is   Vt
a
serendipitous
discovery

hence
,
it
is
not
ethically
wrong
to
inform
relatives
of
the
carrier
about
the
possible
risk
and
the
decision
to
whether
they
should
undergo
similar
genetic
testing   Wform
would
then
be
up

them

increasing

of

will
result
in
more
adult

living

taking
care

their

the
convenience
and
problems
this
technology
brings
to

make
it
hard
for
us
to
decide
whether
it
should
be
legal
to
track

.

this
strategy
calls
for
having
private
clinics
to
-   ArtOrDet
be
within
a
hundred
metres
from
the
homes
.

in   Wci
the   Wci
current   Wci

people
depend
more

more
on

an

the

that

major

that
they

the
government
came
up
with
the   Mec
maintenance
of
parents
act
in
the   ArtOrDet
1996
and
has
been
studying
to
best   Rloc-
use
this   ArtOrDet
legal
pressure
to
ensure
that
the   ArtOrDet
children
will
take
care
of
their
parents
as   Ssub
filial   Ssub
obligations   Ssub
would
reduce
the
reliance
of
the
elderly
on
the
government
,   Ssub
therefore   Ssub
,
the
government
's
budget
on
the
elderly
need
not
be
as
huge
.

hence
,
there
is
a
worry
that
the
government
will
neglect
the
subsidies
to
other
important
sectors
,
such
as
education
and
defence.however
,
people
should
not
worry
about
this
because   SVA
increasing
subsidies
for
elderly
can
increase
the
new
opportunity
for
the
young
generation
.

thus
,
the
responsibility
of
the
younger
generation
can
be
greatly
reduced
from   Srun
decrease   ArtOrDet
need
of
caretakers
and
medical
costs
.

this
is
because
molten
salt
reactor
has
different
safety
approaches
which
can   Prep
prevent
the
meltdown
.

a
large
amount
of
the
expenditure
used
is
contributed
by
government
taxation
on
the
working
citizens   Wform
.

calories   Nn
restricted

can
induce
a
slowdown
of
the

and
showing   Vform
increased   Vform

,
resistance

,
prevent   Vform
brain

and
lastly
on   Wci
less   Wci

.

signboards
that
are
in
-   ArtOrDet
area
of
traffic
congestion
and
other
possible
affected
areas
would
be
updated
and
give
suggestion   Nn
to
the
drivers
to
redirect
them
away
from
the
traffic
congestion
.

to
improve
the
solar
heating
system
,
engineers
add   Vform
accessorial
energy
equipment
to
it
such
as
electrical   ArtOrDet
heater
.

being   Wci
aware
of
it
,
they
may
choose
to
go
through
some
genetic
tests
to
check
whether
the
disorder
presents   Vform
(
scientific
american
,
2008
)
.

although
it
would
take
years
to
develop
such
advanced
technology
and
probably
spend   Wci
quite
a
large
sum
of
money
,
researches   Wci
and   Wci
studies
have
to
be
done
to
tackle
the
faster
mounting
nuclear
waste
problem
.

so
they
think
it
is
not
deserved   Wci
.

the
amount
of
subsidy
on
hospitalization
will
be
determined
by
-   ArtOrDet
means-testing
.

in
effect
,
more
productive
children
will
be
raised
and
there
will
be
sufficient
numbers
of
younger
generations
to
replace   Um
those   Um
of   Um
the
older
generations
as
they
retire
.

cruelty
leads
to
insensitivity
towards
death
and
violence
,
which
links   Vt
to
-   Others
crime
rates
.

i
will
further
elaborate
on
my
stand
based   ArtOrDet
on
the
above
two
aspects
.

for
instance   Vt
,
the
government
should
spend
part
of
the
national
budget
in
trying
to
increase
the
fertility
rate
.

they
need
to
recognize
that
the
effectiveness
of
any
strategies
will
depend
on
every
individual
involvement
.

moreover
,
the
ever
increasing
risk
of
terrorism
will
result
in
a
much
threatening
situation
if
-   ArtOrDet
nuclear
weapon
is
been   Rloc-
stolen
.

one
example   Wci
would
be
designing
a
fridge
that
uses
less
power
to
run
.

obviously
,
to

thus

by

the

on   Trans
the   Trans

,
some

have
the

that

also
concern   Wci
about

this

the

the
amount
of

on   Rloc-
the

a

apart
from
these
schemes

singapore
is
also
trying

to
create
an

,   Mec
lifts   Spar

modified   Spar
to

using

to

being

having

,
alert
alarm
system
,
building
of
ramps
and
link
ways
to
facilitate
wheelchair
access
,
and
a
lot
more
.

it
is
in
the
government
's
interest
that
these

do
receive
an
appropriate
amount
of
attention
and
care
so
that
they
will
not   WOinc
be   WOinc
deprived   WOinc
of   WOinc

then

we

taking   Wci

a

furthermore
,
they
have
been
providing

organisations
(
australian   Cit

)

in
this
forum
,
the
young
generation
is
expected
to
spend
more
time
and
be
more
understanding
towards
the
elderly.the
government
also
encourage   Vform
the

to
run   Wci
a
healhty
lifesyle
,
such
as
not
smoking
,
consuming
a
healthy
diet
,
and
exercising
regularly
.

for
example
,
like
the
surveillance
camera
,
peeping
toms
and
other
criminals
commonly
use
them
for
crimes
,
yet
why
does
the
government
still
allow
such
technology
to
be
used
.   Mec

critics
of
this
position
point
out
their
concerns
over
the
misuse
of
the
funds
once
it
is
-   Vt
made
available
.

this
determines
how
accurate
the
engineer
might   Vt
have   Vt
been
in
his
work
and
also
if
he
-   Vt
looked
at
nature
as
a
considerable   Um
factor
during
his
designing
process
.

there
is
an
invisible
link
.

thus
,
a
serendipitous
technology
can
be
seen
as
a
conventional
technology
-   V0
with
less
research
.

the
issue
of
how
to
attract
consumers
is
none   Others
business
with   Prep
engineers
.

mobile
phones
,
bicycles
and
electric
appliances
are
the   ArtOrDet
examples
of
the
application
of
the   ArtOrDet
technological
creativity
.

the
elderly
have
to
be
convinced
to
adopting   Vt
of   Prep
a
healthy
and
balanced
lifestyle
.

moreover
,
the
opponents
misunderstood
the
distribution
of
electric
power
generation
.

critics   Trans
though   Trans
have
been
quick
to
identify
that   ArtOrDet
the
``
unauthorised
reading
and
changing
of
rfid
data
''
(
tan
and
li
2008
)
as
an
encroachment
of
privacy
.

moreover
,
the
rods
are
designed
with
graphite   Wform
tip
which
,
when
first
inserted
,
will
increases
the
reactivity
.

that
is
the   ArtOrDet
reason
why
we
always
have
to
improve
it
,
to
nurture
it
.

when
the   Nn
radioactive
waste
is
not
properly
stored
in
location
that
are   SVA
of
safe
distance
away
from
people
,
the
people
may
be
exposed
to
harmful
radiation
resulting
in
serious
health
effects
.

while
some
argue
that
the
adoption
of
rfid
is
a
violation
of
human
's   Npos
privacy
,
it
is   Rloc-
indeed
helps
to
protect
the
safety
of

-   ArtOrDet
public
and

from
the
trend
and
progress
of
nuclear
energy
,
i
can
predict
that
the
future
will
rely   Pref
very   Pref
much
on
nuclear
energy
to
power
the
world
.

therefore
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
to
an
acceptable
level
whereas   Trans
it
covers
the
neediest
that
are
desperate
for
help
,
while   Srun
most   Srun
of
the
other
portions
of
the
public
fund
should
be
invested
into
the
expansion
of
the
nation
to
generate
more
funds
for
the

when
the
investments
ripen
.

in   Um

however
,
according
to
the
american
association
for
mental
retardation
aamr
[

]
,
revealing
of
genetic
testing
results
is
not
a
form
of
discrimination
but
it
is
to
be
fair
to
those
children
with
these
genetic
diseases
as
the
child   Nn
will
be
enrolled
into
the
school
that
provide   SVA
a
better
environment
for
them
to
study
in
.

for
example
,
lee
kuan
yew
,
minister
mentor
of
singapore
,
is
still
active
in
the   Nn
politic   Nn
by
advising
the   ArtOrDet
young
politicians
.

therefore
,
as
much
as
other
-   ArtOrDet
problems
,
mainly
those
dealing
with
the
economy
,
may
seem
to
demand
and
need
more
immediate
attention
,
the
ageing
population
issue
can
not
be
ignored
and
the
spending
on
this
area
should
not
be
reduced
in
order
for
majority
of
the
population
to
benefit
.

for
example
,
japan
's
atomic
energy
research
institute
based
in
kashiwa
has
already
operated
a
similar
reactor
as
the
vhtr
which
is
able
to
reach
a
record
high
temperature
of
950
degree
celsius
in
2004
.   Rloc-

being
covered
by
healthcare
insurance
has
become
critical
for
old
people
-   Srun
especially
those
with
disabilities
and
chronic
illness
associated
with
aging
.

instead
,
the
government
should
allow
its
public
spending
on
the
aged
to
hang   Wtone
around   Wtone
a   Wci
certain
percentage
.

the
findings
were
used
for
prevention   SVA
to   SVA
these
illness   Vt
,
thus
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
who
are
more
prone
to
these
diseases
are
able
to
take
more
precaution
to   Trans
their
health
.

by
maintaining
a
socially
active
lifestyle
,
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
are
more
resistance
to
health
problems
as
they
are
able
to
keep
both
their
mind
and
body
active
and
healthy
.

in
addition
,
the   ArtOrDet
efficiency
is
raised
effectively
due
to
the   ArtOrDet
high
temperature
,
which
accordingly
reduces
the
use
of
fuel
and
the
cost
of
complementary
equipment
by
50
%
or
more
.

the
reason
for
the
collapse
of
nicoll
highway
was
not
solely
due
to
-   ArtOrDet
mistake
in
the
design
.

this
is
different
from
scwr
-   Mec
which
uses
water
as
the
coolant
and
hence
there
is
a
possibility
of
-   ArtOrDet
pipe
's
corrosion
by
water
.

using
rfid
to
track
people
arises
many
issues   Mec
.

for
instance
,
-   ArtOrDet
central
provident
fund
(
cpf
)
,
a
comprehensive
financial
savings
plan
for
the
workers
-   Mec
has
been
implemented
in
singapore
.

cost   Wci
of   Wci
manufacture   Wci
including
materials
,
expertise
requirement
and
manpower
were   Vt
effectively   Vt
lessened
with
this
concept
.

in
the
1950s
,
the
soviet
union
tested
their
first
atomic
bomb
resulting
in
the
world
having
two
nuclear
super
powers
that
were
conflicting   Wci
with
each
other
over
world
political
dominance
and
military
superiority
.

investing
in
the   ArtOrDet
economic
growth
will
reduce
the
stress
of   Prep
the
younger
generation
as
more
jobs
will
be
provided   Um
more   Um
employment   Um
with   Um
higher   Um
salary   Um
will
be
available
to   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
working   Rloc-
adults   Rloc-
.

first
of
all
,
if
psychology
approaches
were   Wci
introduced
in
the
design
process
,
product
safety
could
be
better
guaranteed
.

therefore
if
the
engineers
of
-   ArtOrDet
titanic
were
prudent
in
the
engineering
design
process
,
they
would
have
included
a
high
margin
of
safety
factor
to
anticipate
possible
failure
during
the   Pref
construction
of   Rloc-
titanic   Rloc-
.

hence
,
the
government
is   Vt
then   Vt
able
to
divert
spending
to   Vt
the   ArtOrDet
national
growth
.

they
perceived
public
spending
on
the
aged
as
a
form
of
liability
to
a
country
because
such
spending
brings
no
future
benefits
to
the
country
,
and
-   V0
cause
the
country
to
neglect
its
development
in
essential
areas
,
such
as
infrastructure
and
transport
facilities
,
which
serve
as
a
pulling
force
for
foreign
direct   Rloc-
investments
.

preparing
for
-   ArtOrDet
an
aging
population
:
the
singapore
experience
.

there
are
also   Prep
worries
over
leaked
confident
information
through
rfid
tags
.

although   Rloc-
such   Rloc-
may   Rloc-
argue   Rloc-
this   Rloc-
way   Rloc-
but   Mec
it
is
better
to
try
rather
than
to
leave   Wci
the
devastating
sickness   Wci
-   Wci
continue
to
haunt
out   Rloc-
-   ArtOrDet
older
generations
.

therefore
,
nuclear
power
actually
costs
about
the   Prep
same
as
coal
.

security
guards
and
camera   Nn
can
also
be
used
to
monitor
the
safety
operation
of
-   ArtOrDet
nuclear
power
plant
and
ensure
that
the
power
plant
is
free
from
terrorists
.

how   Wtone
about   Wtone
taking   Wtone
account   Wtone
of   Wtone
psychology   Wtone
?   Wtone

in
considering
these
three
factors
,
i
feel   Rloc-
that   Rloc-
a
carrier
of
a
known
genetic
risk
is
obligated
to
reveal
the
results
to
his
or
her
relatives
.

public
spending
should
therefore
be
more
focus   Vform
on
providing
excellent
healthcare
facilities
and
services
which
would
benefits   Vform
and
eases   Vform
the
growing
health
crisis
amidst
the
aging
population

how   Wtone
to   Wtone
call   Wtone
up
them
and
work
out
some
big
projects
is
a
tough
task
for
our
government
.

technological
innovations
can
range
from
household
appliances
to
industrial
equipment

housing

and
building
an
elderly-friendly
environment
would
definitely
make   Wci
the
elderly
to
live
more
comfortably
and   Um
rewarding   Um
.   Um

once
these   Wci
researches   Wci
have   Vt
been
done
,
it   WOinc
is   WOinc
not   WOinc
only   WOinc
the   WOinc
vhtr   WOinc
system   WOinc
will   WOinc
benefit   WOinc
,
but
also
many
other
industries
.

it
creates
-   ArtOrDet
modern
value
that
allows
people
of
opposite
sex
to
live
together
without
having
a
family
.

in
my
opinions   Nn
,
the
government
should
use
much
more
money
on   Prep
taking
care
of
elder   Npos
people   Nn
because   WOinc
the   WOinc
following   WOinc
reason   WOinc
:
firstly
,
the
aged
are
citizens
who
-   Vform
contributed
a
lot
of
money
to
-   ArtOrDet
national
treasury
through
compulsory
taxes
like
land-tax
,
income
tax
...
because   Sfrag
in   Sfrag
this   Sfrag
way   Sfrag
or   Sfrag
another   Sfrag
,   Sfrag
that   Sfrag
was   Sfrag
their   Sfrag
money   Sfrag
,   Sfrag
they   Trans
are   Trans
deserved   Trans
to   Vform
receive   Vform
more
care
from
the
authority   Wform
.

however
,
they
were
all
cleared   Wci
up   Wci
by   Prep
proper
guidance
and
much
effort
.

in
all
,
moving
beyond
-   ArtOrDet
law
to
enhance
the
perceptions
of
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
is
a
more
practical
way
to
increase
the
ability
and
willingness
of
the
society
to
coordinate
with
the
government
in
tackling
the
``
grey
tsunami
''
.

to
add
to
the
problems
stated
above
,
the
world
currently
needs
a   ArtOrDet
better
transport   Wform
,
in
terms
of
safety
and
functionalities
as
well
as
its   Rloc-
cost
.

in
addition
,
it
could
be
concluded
that
spending
money
-   Others
on
economy
would
make
people
wealthy
,
which
could
greatly
help
to
ease
the
aging
problem
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
wastes
produced
by
the   ArtOrDet
nuclear
plants
are
highly
radioactive
and
can
not
be
easily
disposed
.

however
once
the
elderly
becomes   SVA
over
dependent
on
technology
,
they
will
be
at
a
loss
once
the
device
is
unable
to
respond
to
its   Um
correct   Um
state   Um
.

in
order
to
gain
political
advantages
,
the
government
or
the
ruling
party
has
applied   Wci
plenty
of
policies
and   Rloc-
acts   Rloc-
to
constraint   Vform
the
freedom
of
individuals
in
giving
opinions
.

spending
on
the   Rloc-
old   Rloc-
does
not
denote
an
economic
dead
end
.

either   Wci
than
talents
,
providing
-   Others
high
level
of
security
is
essential
.

i   Wci
disagree   Wci
against   Wci
the   Wci
idea   Wci
that   Wci
surveillance
technology
such
as
rfid
should
not   Rloc-
be
used
to
track
people
as
some
of
its
benefits
are
more
important
than
privacy
and
freedom
concerns
.

for
example
,
if
individuals
reveal
their
genetic
testing
results
to
their
parent   Nn
,
their
parents
will
feel
very
guilty
and
blame
themselves
as
individuals
had
inherited
their
mutated
gene
(
s
)
.

government
budgets
should
only
cater
on   Prep
-   ArtOrDet
basic
needs
of
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
.

consequently
,
a
disadvantageous
situation
is
created
instead
of
a
beneficial
one
.

however
,
the

when

approaching

however
,

through

for   WOinc
this   WOinc

that   WOinc
the

other

thus   ArtOrDet

find

the

in

that

numerous   Smod

by

although

for

-   ArtOrDet

this

according   Mec

seeking
third
parties
'
opinion
is
not
very
useful
as
they
might   Prep
not
fully
understand
the
situation
that
individuals
are
in
and
often
,
they
make
wrong
judgments
.

some
feel
that
the   ArtOrDet
incorporating
psychology
in   Mec
to   Mec
the
design
process
can
help
to
avoid
such
accidents
from
occurring   Wci
.

while
children
whose

are
diagnosed
to   Wci
have   Wci
a
genetic
disease
can
very
possibly
to   Rloc-
have
it
(

,
they

so
that
i   Pform
can
make
suitable

in
choosing

so

in

to
conventional
belief
,
edison   Nn
just
improved

an

which
had

out
50
years
ago
.

therefore
,
their
balance
can
be
improved
and
-   Sfrag
lead
a
better
life
.

however
,
in
my
opinion   WOinc
,
every
choice
we
made
definitely
has
an
opportunity
cost
which
means
something
has
to
be
given
up
in
order
to
attain
the
objective
we
want
.

hence
,
even
with
the
established
safety
regulations
in
engineering
,   Wci
the
practice
of
psychology
is
essential
in
re-examining
and
evaluating
the
design
products
for
hidden
dangers
to
prevent
disasters
.

among
all   ArtOrDet
kinds
of
nuclear
reactors
,
very-high-temperature
reactor
is
an
advanced
one
and
has
a
broad
prospect
.

access

through
specific
communication
devices
are   Rloc-
designed
for
elders   Npos
'   Npos
usage   Npos
.

secondly
,
some
people
may
think
that
nuclear
reaction   Wform
will
spend   Wci
a
lot
of
money
on   Prep
building   Vform
a   Rloc-
large   Rloc-
factory   Rloc-
and
using   Wci
the   ArtOrDet
high
technology
equipment
.

though
many
may
claim
that
the
bulk
of
the
amount
needed
to
support
the
aged
should
come
from
the
government
who   Pform
has
the
greatest
financial
power
in   Prep
supporting   Vform
them
,
however   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
this
public
spending
should
be
limited
.

however
-   Mec
there
are
six
new
generation
iv
reactors
being
developed
at
the
moment
that
promises   SVA
to
resolve
many
of
the
issues
posed
by
generators
of
the
past
.

firstly
,
vhtr
-   ArtOrDet
generates
energy
in
a
much
simpler
way
compared
to
other
types
of
reactors
.

in
the
article
-   Mec
the
generation
of
innovations
,
rogers
(
2003
)
stressed
that
the
engineering
design
process
for
innovation
including
``
problem
recognition
,
research
,
development
,
commercialization
,
diffusion
and
consequences
''
.

even
though
there
may
be
problems
and
public
opposition
along
the
way
,
but   Rloc-
by
bearing
in
mind
three
main
factors
namely   Mec
:   Mec
the
benefits
of
nuclear
energy
,
the
importance
of
a
strong
defence
and
most
importantly
,
the
importance
of
having
a
set
of
safety
protocols
,
we
are
able
to
push
the
development
of
nuclear
power
to
greater
heights
.

this
group
should
be
categorized   Prep
as
the
vulnerable
group
.

the
payoff
of
this
investment
is
a
highly
efficient
and
the   ArtOrDet
productive
workforce
.

however
,
not
every
elderly
in
the
society
can
get   Vform
to
enjoy
these
perks
,
especially
those
who
are
bounded
by
financial
problems
.

this
includes
desalination
and
damping
up
of
rivers
to
form
water
catchment
areas
.

moreover
,
computer
technology
and
network
technology
broaden   Vt
the
range
of
credit
card
's   Wform
service   Nn
and
make   Vt
a
strong
link
between
the
card
and
our
daily
life   Nn
.

but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
companies
do
save
up   Rloc-
a
lot
in
their
training
costs
as
these
employees
are
more
experienced
,
and
retaining
them
will
cut
down
on
the   ArtOrDet
recruitment
costs
.

last
but
not
least
,
-   ArtOrDet
the
price
of
an
ergonomical
design
should
be
reasonable
.

the
efforts
made
by
our
leaders
though
commendable
,
is   SVA
not
sufficient
to
ensure
the
elderly
interests   V0
.   V0

monitoring
employees
at
workplace   Nn
and
installing
video
cameras
at
public
places
such
as
banks
,
stores
or
restaurants
are
one   Pref
of
the
debatable
issues
today
.

longer

lives
also   Others
meant   Others
that
elders
would
continue
to
play
an
active
role
in
contributing
to
the
economy
and

,
thus
making
them
feeling
a
sense
of
fulfilment

this
can

besides
that   Pform
,
the
rising
price
of
oil
will
eventually
become
much
more
expensive
than
the
radioactive
materials
used
.

to
deal
with
such
challenges
,
research
and
development
as
well
as
-   ArtOrDet
implementation
of
policies
have
come
into
the
picture
.

for
example
,
in
the
singapore
national
service
,
the   Rloc-
professional   Rloc-
nature   Rloc-
of   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
military
officers
,
using
its   Pref
portion
of
dominant
influence
,
typically
make
most
of
the
important
decisions
about
innovation
.

do
you
know
some   Wform
things   Wform
about
the
invention
of
microwave   Wform
?

according
to
ruth
(
2009
)
,
medical
isotopes
used
in
the   ArtOrDet
cancer
research
can
be
supplied
using
accelerators
instead
of
nuclear
reactors
as
it   Pref
is
a
safer
and
cheaper
method
.

after
one
year
,
due
to
economical   Wform
improvement
,
indonesia
's
nett
national
product
raises   Wci
up   Wci
to
20
billion
per
month
.

fortunately
,
a
new
subject
named
``
engineering
psychology
''
has
-   ArtOrDet
already
started
to
boom
recently
,
which
is
concerned
with
adapting
the
equipment
and
environment
to
people
,
based
upon
their
psychological
capacities
and
limitations
.

besides   Trans
-   ArtOrDet
social
impact
to   Prep
the
country
,
political
impact
will
be
another
factor
to
take
into
consideration
.

nevertheless
,
these
two
strategies
are
able   Vt
to
reduce
elder
dependency
.

however
,
the
country
's
modernization
should
be
prioritized
,
as
this
helps
to   Vform
improve
the
welfare
of
the
elderly
in
the
long
run
.

science
with
the
invention
of
many
toxic
chemicals
either
used
for

or
nuclear
weapons
,
are   SVA
responsible
for
higher
infertility
rate
in
human   Nn
and
many

.

in
conclusion
,
rfid
usage
in
human
tracking
is
not
as
simple
and
beneficial
as
we
-   Vm
thought
of
.

for
example
,
in
singapore
,
people
begin
to
save
a
certain
percent
of
his
salary
into
his   Pref
bank
account   Nn
,
in
order
to
pay
the
housing
loan
,
car
loan
or
for
advanced
age
.

although   Trans
the
initial
clinical
outcomes
are
positive
,
safety
is
a
major
factor
why
the
robotic
surgical
system
still
remains
fearful
to
the
public
.

today
-   Mec
the
principal
challenges
are
using
green
resources
and
energy
to
get   Wci
a   Wci
radical   Wci
reduction   Wci
of   Wci
co2
emissions
to
deal   Wci
with   Wci
climate
change
and
to
pursue
sustainable
development
.

in
the
1980s
and
1990s
,
the
research
of
solar
energy
fell
into
the
low
tide
because
that   Rloc-
the
price
of
petroleum
fell
down   Rloc-
and
the   ArtOrDet
solar
energy
product   Nn
was   SVA
too
expensive
and
there
was
no

breakthrough
about   Prep
the
development
of

after
that

the

to

to
this
powerful
chemical
medicine
gradually   WOadv
.

implementing
this
technology
properly
can
help
improve
security
in
working   Wform
places

in
conclusion
,
the
person
who
went
for
genetic
testing
should
have
the
final
say
on
whether
to
reveal
the
genetic
testing
result
so
that
he
will
not
be
discriminated
against
or
even
denied
of
his
basic
human
rights

problems   Spar

as
the
vhtr
is
able
to
produce
two
products
,
hydrogen

electricity

concurrently
,
it
helps
to
reduce
the

of
a
new
nuclear

around

as

is   SVA
created
.

when
come   Pref
to   Pref
analyze   Vform
and
select   Vform
solution
,
here
we
need
to
decide
which
solution
is
the   ArtOrDet
best
suited
for
implementation
to
the
problem
.

there
are
many
areas
where

also   Trans
,
as

there

for

-
the

when

the

the

process
of   Prep
various

are   SVA
believed
to
be
able
to
be
eased

if
not
overcame   Vt
.

it
has
been
estimated
that
there
will
be
a
four-fold
increase
in
the
utilization
of
health
resources
in   Prep
2030
,
based
on
the
increased   Wform
numbers   Nn
of
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
and
assuming   Um
the   Um
same   Um
utilization   Um
rate   Um
.   Mec

the
government
is
aware
of
this
situation
and
they   Pref
have   Pref
come
up
with
a
solution
to
overcome
this
problem
by
linking
up
acute   Wci
hospitals
with
community
ones
.

first   ArtOrDet
way
is
changing
the
way
energy
is
generated
,
such
as
changing
petrol
engines
which
produce
carbon
dioxide
and
hydrocarbons
to
fuel
cell   Nn
which
only
produce
water
and
oxygen
.

the
development
on   ArtOrDet
education
sector
will
enable
the   Vt
further
generations
to
be
more
educated
and
to
possess
a
higher
level
of
skills
.

for
example
,
-   ArtOrDet
landslide
occurs
on
-   ArtOrDet
work
site
due
to
soil
erosion
after
the   ArtOrDet
heavy
downpour
.

living
expenditure
for
the
elderly
is   Vt
increased
by   Wci
the   ArtOrDet
rising
medical
costs
and
standard
of
living

.

even
if
it
does
,
more
often
than
not
,
it
would   Nn
take   Nn
years
before
the
end
product
can
be
sold
to
the
general
public
for
use
.

apart
from
the
loopholes
in
the
system
of
state-owned
enterprises
,
economic   Wci
shortage   Wci
of   Prep
china
's
private
companies
also
hampers   SVA
the
innovation
process
.

if
it   Pref
can
be
integrated
together
,
the
safety
of
-   ArtOrDet
scwr
will
be
enhanced   WOadv
dramatically   WOadv
.

a
decrease
in
the
spending
to
fulfill
the
constant
needs
of
an
aging
population
will
not
be
worthwhile
to   Um
incur   Um
the   Um
economic   Um
loss   Um
resulted   Um
from   Um
the   Um
communication   Um
breakdown   Um
.

the
second
advantage
of
vhtr
is
that
it
does   SVA
not   SVA
only
produce
electricity
but
at
the
same
time
create
hydrogen
fuel
as
well
(
butler
,
2004
)
.

as
a
result
,
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
not
be
limited
as
it
is
needed
to
help
these
elderly
.

in
this
way
,
companies
can
make
their   WOadv
goal
in
a
much
faster
way
.

these   ArtOrDet
information
is
further
recorded
and
processed
by

for
instant   Wform
,
in
the
process
of
consuming
hydrogen
fuel
,
greenhouse
gasses   Mec
will
be
generated
,
which
may
contribute
to
global

.

therefore
,
skunkworks
environment
usually
are   SVA
not
comfortable
to
work
in
.

aging
is
the
accumulation   Mec
of
changes
in
an
organism
or
object
over
time
.

also
the
containment
structures
of
modern
reactors
were   Vt
designed
to
effectively
prevent
the
escape
of
radioactivity
even
if
it
sustained   Vt
severe
damages

these
inventions
have
indeed
help   Vform
a
lot
in

become
the
top
one

among
all
the

which

the
human

health

in
conclusion
,
surveillance
technology
should
not
be
banned
to
track
people
as
it
not   WOadv
only   WOadv
can   WOadv
save
life
but
also
improves   Vform
the

has   Vform
played
another
imperative
role
to

the
process
of

hence
,
the
individual
should   Vt
have
the
final
say
in
whether
to
reveal
the
results
of
such
testing
.

it
means
you

6000

for

,
which
is
such
a
large
amount
especially
in
the
economic
critics   Mec
recently

locating
the
sunshades
at
remote
areas
,   Mec
reduce   SVA
the
probability
of

in
case
of
any

.

in
other
words
,
most
elderly
-   Nn
are
rather
dependent
on
their
children
to
support
them
-   Mec
particularly
those
who
suffered   Vt
from
chronic
illnesses
.

-   ArtOrDet
post-it
note
was
invented
in
this
way
according   Cit
to   Cit
rogers   Cit
.

on
the
other
hand
,
the
danger
of
nuclear
radiation
,
fear
of
terrorism
and
the
high
initial
and
running
cost
of
a
generation
iv
nuclear
plant
,
makes   SVA
us
consider
if
there
are
any
other
alternatives
.

terrorists
can   Vm
also
have
the
chance
to
magnify
the
destruction
by
attack   Vform
the   ArtOrDet
nuclear
plant   Nn
and
the   ArtOrDet
freighters
that
convey   Wci
radioactive
substance   Nn
.

besides   Trans
,
the
introduction
of
-   ArtOrDet
central
provident
fund
(
cpf
)
,
a
mandatory
saving
scheme
,
is
also
a
policy
carried
out
by
-   ArtOrDet
government
to
ease
the
aging
process
.

this
will
have
the
effect
of
helping
them
to   SVA
be
financially
independent
even
beyond
their
retirement
age
.

it
also
allows
us
to   Mec
utilize
more
capable
generation
iv
reactors
sooner
and
helps
reduce
the
amount
of
nuclear
wastes
.

they
would
end
up
living
on
the
streets
if
no
help
is   Vt
given
to
them
.

thus
,
to
prevent
relatives
or
parents
to   Vform
think   Vform
negatively
,
a
carrier
of
a
known
genetic
risk
should
not
be
obligated
to
tell
his
or
her
relatives
.

as
some
may
argue
,
maintenance
also
needs
money
and
may
lead
to
the   ArtOrDet
increase
in
the   Um
average   Um
costs   Um
.

subsequently
two
explosions
occurred
resulting
in
massive
losses
(
chernobyl
accident
,
2009
)
.

moreover
,
part
of
the   Wci
public   Wci
fund   Wci
should
also
be
spend   Vt
on
re-training
schemes
for
working
adults
so
as
to
improve
their
work
quality
and
efficiency
,
as
well
as
to
keep
them
skilled
and
valuable
for
the   ArtOrDet
industry
.

in   Wci
details   Wci
,
the
cost
can
be
reduced
by
reducing
the
refuelling   Npos
outages   Npos
'   Npos
number   Npos
,
compacting
the
reactor
vessel
,
sampling
the
vessel
internals
,
reducing
the
loop
number
,
shortening
the
pipes
,
integrating
the
primary
components
and
so
on
.

for
example
,
research
and
development
in
pharmaceutical   Nn
is
particularly
important
as
the
creation
of
new
drugs
will
help
in
the
advancement
of
medical
and
clinical
studies
.

in
my
opinion
,
the
contribution
of
current
researches   Nn
and
technology
is
very
important
in
easing
-   ArtOrDet
aging
process
.

among
all
those   Pform
socially
determined
resistance
on   Prep
the
way
of
innovation
,
one
fatally
significant
phenomenon
is
the
unfair
competition
between
monopolies
and
other
less
competent
companies
.

firstly
,
many
companies
lack
money
to
support
innovations
in
their
product
design
.   Prep

however
,
according
to
the
gif
,
the
six
concepts   Others
,
including
the
vhtr
,
had   Vt
incorporated   Vt
a
high
security-proof
mechanism
.

there
is
also
another
design
feature
of
vhtr
that
makes
it
a
preferable
choice
of
reactor
over
scwr
.

together
with
the
increase
of
unemployment
rates
in
singapore
,
it
presents
a
worrying
trend
of
its
citizen
entering
the
retirement
age
of
their
life
.

afonso
's
view
supports
my
stand
that
public
funds
should   Vform
be   Vform
diverting
into
-   ArtOrDet
education
system
is
fundamental
.

-   ArtOrDet
chernobyl
accident
gives   Vt
people
a
big
shock
.

because
without
having
a
proper
testing
at
all
stages
in
the   Vform
process
,
you
may
find
yourself
into
trouble
later
on
.

the
next
question
-   Trans
needs
to
be
debated
is
:
``
how
much
money
should
the   ArtOrDet
government
spend
on   Npos
the   Npos
medical   Npos
care
for
elder
people
?
``
.

the
vhtr
is
equipped
with   Vt
superior
passive
safety
feature
with
its
underground
construction
,
which
also
greatly
increases
its
security
and
physical
protection
.

however
,
it
is
the
individual
's
responsibility
to
tell
his
family
members
regarding
this   Others
.

in
order
to
develop
our
society
without
exhausting
all
the
fossil
fuels
or
sacrificing
our
environment
,
we
have
to
find
new
energy
resources
to
take
-   ArtOrDet
place
of
traditional
fossil
fuels
.

despite   Um
scandinavian   Um

however

help   Vt
to
anticipate
some
events
that
led
to

therefore
allowing

secondly

in

some
would
argue
that
it
is
of

social
obligation
that
this
should
be

in
the
first

,
all

think
about
the   ArtOrDet
questions
,
such
as
-   Cit
``
is
the
energy
able
to
replace

?

numerous
civil
right   Nn
groups
and
privacy
groups
oppose
and
regard
it   Others
as
a
severe
violation
of
the
tight   Mec
of   Prep
privacy
and
freedom
.

only
then
,
singapore
will
be
a
successful
``   Vt

the
result
of
the

linked
to
many

as

as
destroying   Spar
animals

.

the
government
should
limit
on   Prep
public
spending
on
healthcare
for
the
aged
,
and
the
limit
should
satisfy
the
healthcare
needs
of
all
the
elderly
.

another
is
that
both
type   Nn
of
technology
requires   SVA
people
to
ultilise
a
certain
amount
of
creativity
and
good
peception
to
develope   Mec
them
completely
but
differ
when
it
comes
to
the
type
of
people
it   Pref
usually
involves   SVA
.

thus
,
these
policies
are
ineffective
without
first
changing
the
mindset
of
employers
and   Rloc-
would   Rloc-
eventually   Rloc-
cause   Rloc-
social   Rloc-
and   Rloc-
economical   Rloc-
problems   Rloc-
in   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
society   Rloc-
.   Rloc-

in
conclusion
,
surveillance
technology
should
be
banned
as
it
invade   SVA
our
privacy
and
disturb   SVA
the
society
which   Um
outweighs   Um
the   Um
ability   Um
to   Um
provide   Um
security   Um
,   Um
which   Um
might   Um
not   Um
be   Um
necessary   Um
true   Um
.   Um

in
fact
,
it
calls
into
the
question
whether
the
elderly
really
benefits   Rloc-
from
the
policy
implemented
in
the
aspect
of
financial
security
,
employment
and
living
arrangements
for   Rloc-
elderly   Rloc-
.

hence
,
we   Wtone
can
conclude
that
social
factors
can
determine
the
fortune
of
a
new
technology
.

in
addition
,
resource
crisis   Nn
,
especially
the
shortage
of

,
pushes   Vt
the
development
of

admittedly
,
genetic
testing
raises
legal
issue   Nn
,   Srun
however
,
an
individual
who
tested
positive
for
a
genetic
disease
has
to
decide
whether
to
make
known
the
results
of
genetic
testing
to
relevant
third
parties
such
as
family
members
or
relatives
who
have
the
possibility
of
passing
on
the
similar
disease
.

by
increasing
public
spending
on
an
aging
population
,
governments
risk
overlooking
important   ArtOrDet
areas
of
the
country
's
development
at   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
expense   Rloc-
of   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
country   Rloc-
's   Rloc-
overall   Rloc-
well   Rloc-
being   Rloc-
.

however
,
this
potential
peril
can
be   Wci
avoided
by
testing
and
choosing
suitable
materials
which
can
withstand
huge
pressure
and
corrosion
.

the
salts
can
keep
the   Nn
reactor
's
temperature
at
around
700
oc
,
which
is
acceptable
in
comparison
with
the
others
.

before
taking
effective   ArtOrDet
actions   Rloc-
,
leaders
must
first
realise
that
any
further
expansion
of
retirement
benefits
would
only
impoverish
future
generations
and
limit
future
public
spending
(

p.g

another
problem
we
face
in
singapore
is
the
lack
of
experience
our
country
has
in
the
innovative
engineering
field   ArtOrDet
.

however
,
this
is
rarely
seen   Wci
due
to
the
fact
that
most
of
them
do
not
wish
to
continue
working
into
old
age
,   Srun
they
believe
that
they
deserve
to
rest
.

molten
lead
,
compared
to
helium
,
is
a
superior
and
cheaper
heat
transfer
medium
-   Mec
and
hence
increasing
the
portability
of
the
power
plant
by
reducing
the
need
for
a
large
intermediate
heat
exchanger
.

if
the
decision
is
leaved   Vform
to
others
,
the
chance
of
perfect
equality
is
also
questionable
.

secondly
,
an
article
on
electronic
privacy
information
center
(
anonymous
2005
)
highlighted
that
using
rfid
to
track
children
-   Npos
movement
and
location
not
only
invades
their
privacy
but
can
also
be
very
detrimental
to
their
dignity
.

singaporeans
are
required
to
save   Wci
a
certain
amount
of
their
salaries
into
their
cpf
accounts
.

some
consider   Wci
that
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
so
that
money
can
be
diverted
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

a
new
scheme
,
wellness
programme
was
created
recently
to
promote
healthy

and
social

for

especially
the
elderly

,   Srun
only   Srun
then   Srun
can
the
economies
as
well
as
the
aging
population
benefit
healthily   Rloc-
from
the
effective
use
of
tax
payers
'
money
.

apart
from
that
,
-   ArtOrDet
government
's
initiative
in
raising
the
retirement
age
is
also
blamed   Wci
to
be
not
effective
.

disease
has
been
a
great
concern
of   Trans
human   Nn
from
-   ArtOrDet
very
long
time
ago
,
but
medical
system
seems
not
to
be
enough
in
the
fight
with
countless
threats
that
steals
many
human
lives
.there
are
many
limitations
that
only   Wform
can   Wform
be
surpassed
by
the
magic
of
engineers
'
technology
.

finally
,
we
could
say
that
the
process
of
the   ArtOrDet
aircraft
innovation
was
quite
devious   Wci
.

in
addition
,
nuclear
wastes   Nn
repositories
require
geological
isolation
over   Um
in   Um
areas   Um
like   Um
yucca   Um

.

with   Prep
the
integration
of
both
rfid
and
global

system
(
gps
)
,   Rloc-
it   Rloc-
is
used
to
locate
workers
'   Mec
during
emergencies
.

for
example
,
the
rising
cost
of
health   Wci
spending   Rloc-
for
the
elderly
has
taken
its
toll
on
them   Pref
and
many
could   Vt
not
afford
that   Pref
.

however
,
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
on
another
country
has
been
non-existent
since
wwii
as
countries
realize
the
chaos
it
could
cause
.

singapore
's
transportation
system
is
well-known
as   Wci
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
.

no
one
can
guarantee
that
children
who
live
nearby
their
parents
will
eventually
take
good
care
of
their   Pref
parents   Pref
.

this
event
would
turn   Vt
out
differently
if
the
management
teams
of
the
building
were
psychologically
prepared
,   Srun
in   Srun
other
words
,
educated
or
briefed
on
such
issues
,
the
building
would
have
been
evacuated
almost
immediately
,
even
having
a
buffer
time
of
16
hours
on
hand
to
do
it
,
saving
the
life   Nn
of
33
and   Rloc-
even   Rloc-
possible   Rloc-
to   Rloc-
conduct   Rloc-
remedy   Rloc-
to   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
building   Rloc-
.

therefore
,
they
believe
that
even
though
'work   Um
scientist   Um
'   Um
could
probably
remove   Vt
human
factors
psychologically
,
the
hardware
technical
problems
would
still
trigger   Vt
similar
accidents
by
themselves
.

therefore
-   Mec
a
large
part
of
the
safety
of
the
engineering
systems
lies
on   Prep
human
activities
.

hydrogen

has
been

but
the

it

in

in
this
essay
,
how
does   Rloc-
engineering
design
processes
-   Vm
cope
with
the
energy
crisis
will
be
discussed
in
terms
of
gathering
pertinent
information
and
analysis
and
selection   Vform
of   Vform
an
optimized
solution
.

government
needs
to
focus
the
spending
on
more
important
sectors
first
like
economic
development
before
worrying
about
healthcare
for
the
elderly
.

anyhow
,
as
a
member
in   Trans
the
family
,
it   Pref
is
obligated
to
tell
the
genetic
test
results
to
-   Pref
own
relatives
.

furthermore
,
when
considering
the
design
of
the
product
,
there
is
a
need
to
make
special
considerations
that
are
suitable
for
the   ArtOrDet
elderly
use
.

everyone
should
-   V0
responsible
and
play
-   ArtOrDet
important
role
in
the
family
.

as
mentioned
earlier
,
one
reason
why
we
should
not
limit
the
spending
is
that
it
may
not
be
fair
to
the
elderly
when
the   Rloc-
public   Rloc-
spending   Rloc-
is   Rloc-
limited   Rloc-
as   Rloc-
among   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
elderly   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
there
may
be
people   Pref
who
are
really
in
great
need
of
the   ArtOrDet
support
from
the
government
.

second
,
the
lta
's
personnel
,
due
to
slothfulness
,
did
not
do
his/her   Pform
job
on
ensuring
the
safety
of
building
works
by
performing
checks
on
-   ArtOrDet
construction
work
.

the
upgrading
process
might
cause
inconveniences
to
the
residents
but
-   Pref
is
a
pay   Wci
off
that
they
have
to
bear
with
for
a
better
tomorrow
.

the
debiting
and
crediting
process
is
automated
,
thus
the
citizen
need
not
do
anything
but
he
will
still
be
notified
regularly
with
his
cpf
account
statement
.

swcr
does
not
recycle
the   ArtOrDet
waste
which
is
not
that
safe
.

there
are
various
non-profitable
organizations
all
over
the
world
seeking
cure   Nn
for
common
illness
among
elderly
an
example
will
be
for
parkinson
disease
there
is
the
parkinson
's
institute
and
clinical
center
in
america
.

hence
,
we   Wtone
still   Wtone
should   Wtone
not   Wtone
limit   Wtone
the   Wtone
public   Wtone
spending   Wtone
on   Wtone
the   Wtone
aged   Wtone
.

one
reason
for
revealing
the
result
to
the   ArtOrDet
family
members
is
that
the
result
is
not
only
applicable
to
the
individual
but
also
to
other   Pref
family
members
,
as
they
may
also
have
inherited
the
diseases   Nn
.

the
design   Vt
engineers
were
said
to
put
so
much
effort
into
these
trivial
factors
rather
than
the
safety
concern
.

even
in   Wci
the   Wci
midnight
,
there
still   WOadv
must   WOadv
have   Wci
workers
to
monitor
the
system
to
ensure
that
the
system
is
functional
for
24
hours
.

for
my
home
country
,
china
,
although
its
design
process
for
innovation
has
been   Vt
improved
a
lot
,
there
still
remain
several
factors
which
hamper
-   WOadv
the
innovation
process
significantly   WOadv
.

but   Rloc-
since   Mec
the
living   Wci
cost   Wci
in
singapore
has
been
so
high
that
it
is
even   Rloc-
called
as   Prep
the
10th
most
expensive
city
-   Others
(
hoe
,
2009
)
,
-   ArtOrDet
government
may
consider
increasing
-   Wci
incentives
to   Um
increase   Um
the   Um
population   Um
of   Um
new   Um
generation   Um
therefore   Srun
,
increasing   Sfrag
the   Sfrag
total   Sfrag
number   Sfrag
of   Sfrag
work   Sfrag
force   Sfrag
and   Sfrag
reducing   Sfrag
the
percentage
of
total
aging
population
.

it
is
inevitable
that
public
spending
will
significantly
increase
with
the
aging
population
.

besides
,
the
primary
gfr
core
is
loaded
with
transuranics
from
spent
lwr
fuel
such
that
the
plutonium
created
in
waste
reprocessing
is
diluted
and
consequently
the
proliferation
resistance
of
the
nuclear
power
plants
is
enhanced   Rloc-

however
,
this
is
insufficient   Um
as
there
are
also
many
benefits
that
lifelong

can
exert   Um
on   Um
oneself   Um

this
is
because
,
technology
provides
the
automation
and
machines
to
increase
productivity
solving
the
problem
of
a
shrinking
workforce   Wci
.

i   Wtone
agree   Wtone
to
a

extent
that
current
public

be

so
that
this   Wci

however
,
these

were
partly
caused
by
the
overpowering
economical   Wform
and
political

``

by

the

be

so
that

can
reduce

their

while
it
is
true
that

have
their
reserved   Rloc-

to

about

an

first
and

,
renewable
-   Srun

are
much
more
environmentally
friendly
compared
with
fossil

.

the
damping

of

to

catchment
areas
is   Vform
in
fact
being
implemented
.

the
cost
of
the   ArtOrDet
nuclear
plant
can
be
divided
into
3
main
parts
:
capital   Mec
cost
,
operating   Mec
cost
and
fuel   Mec
cost
.

for
example
,
-   ArtOrDet
singapore
government
gives
different
type   Nn
of
incentive   Nn
and

to
support   Wci

to
have
and

.

firstly
,
the   ArtOrDet
physician
is
a
profession
that
is
bounded   Wform
with   Prep
standard
protocols
and
most
importantly
the   ArtOrDet
physician   Nn
possesses   SVA
medical

therefore
,
the

been
promoting
active   Wform

in
a

and
i
have
absolute

out

to
make

truly
the

solution
to   WOinc

.

besides
the
complexity   Um
amount
of
anti-aging
medicine
available
in
the
market
,
the   ArtOrDet
advanced
technology
has
also
helped
to
ease
a
generation
into
old
age
despite
the
fact
that
some
elderly
-   Wci
might
not
be
able
to
accept
these

this
allows
elders   ArtOrDet
how   Um
to   Um
less
physical

.

one
-   Wci
such
technology
was   Vt
the

national
budgets
and
economies
will
come
under
pressure
as
growing
numbers
of

elderly
persons
are
supported
by
relatively
fewer

.

this   Um
allows   Um
the   Um

which   Um
are   Um
not   Um
unnecessary   Um

in
addition
,
an
increase
of   Prep
infrastructure
can
attract
investment
from
abroad
because
the   ArtOrDet
facilities
are
fully
equipped
.

the
results
from

to

however   Wci
,   Wci
even
though
the
disclosure
empowers

take

measures
,
it
might

when

enterprisers   Wform
decide
to
adopt
a
new

,
the   ArtOrDet
social
factors
will
directly
affect
their

some
may
argue
that
fruit
and
gymnastic   Nn
do
not
play
any
part
in
easing
the

the
elderly
needed   Vt
some
form
of
monitoring

to
help
improve
their
safety
where   Wci
no
one
is
able
to
be
around
to
look
after

all
the

.

employers

will
also
no

having   Vt
any

hence

should
be
deeply   Wtone
thought   Wtone

to

subsequently
,
various
groups

investigated
into   Rloc-
this   ArtOrDet
case
,
and
some
of

came
into   Prep
a   ArtOrDet
conclusion
that
the
most

way
to

again
lied   Wci
in
the

whereas
the   ArtOrDet

opposed   Wci
that
the

was
actually
the   WOinc

failures   WOinc
of
the

,
and
the
prevention   Wci
could
hardly
be
simply
regarded
as

for

,
in

,
many

with

from
the
hindered
growth
of   Nn
nuclear
energy
in
north
korea
,
we
can
see
that
the
abuse
of
nuclear
power
such
as
scwrs
is
less
likely
to
happen
nowadays
.

hence
,
this
design
reduces
the
probability
of   Srun
nuclear   Srun
arms
proliferation
.

however
,
some
experts
have   Rloc-
pointed
out
that
if
such
high
temperature
is
stimulated
within
a
reactor
,
new
hardy
alloy
may
be
necessary
to
protect
the
inside
layer
of
the
reactor
.

the
recycling
is
done
only
for
the
completely
used   ArtOrDet
uranium
fuel
.

as
these
costs
decline
,
businesses
become
more
profitable
when
they
effectively
try
to
make
use
of
the
incentive
from
the
government
and
ultimately   ArtOrDet
translate
to
better
salaries
for   Um
consumerism   Um

,
there

globalization
has
caused
the
demand

surge
up   Rloc-
to
the
extent
by   Wci
which   Wci
the

of

could   Vm
not

hence
leading

also
,
nuclear

operational

in

,
we
realized   Vt
that
burning

produce   SVA
the   ArtOrDet
large

.

the
public

used
for
the

programs
can
be
diverted
into

sectors
instead

much   Trans
should
be
done

to
avoid
social
and
economical
problems
in

in
view
of
the
rising
fuel
prices
in
the
recent

,
car
manufacturers   Nn
have
addressed
the
need
to
reduce

in

,
so
as
to
be
able

pass
on
minimal

still

tackling

if

a

,
it
addresses
one
pertinent
problem
on
the
way
we
view

after
reviewing
this

,
some
experts
may   Vt
feel   Vt
that
incorporating

could
aid   Vt
in

on
the

covers
many
aspects
of

,
starting
from

.

hence
,
we
must
be

and
focused   Vt
to   Wci
know   Vform
which
direction
our
country
is
heading
towards   Prep
and

towards   Sfrag
its   Sfrag
development   Sfrag
to   Sfrag
today   Sfrag
's   Sfrag

,   Sfrag
the   Sfrag

an   Sfrag

it   Sfrag

both

;   Mec
however
,   Mec
the
procedure
of
finding
these
two
discoveries
and
the
development
of
them
are
different
.

to
conclude
,
revealing
of
the
positive
results
is
essential
to
help
not
only   SVA
the
carriers
,
but
also
their

psychologically
and
physically
.

another
contributing
factor
of
the
success
of
invention
will
be
the
buying
power
of
-   ArtOrDet
consumer
,
which
very
much
depends
on
the
economic
situation
then   Wci
.

the
abundance
of
uranium
on

also
means   Others
that
it
is
a
more
powerful
way
of
generating
electricity
.

during

the

help
reduce

and
subsequently
reduce

(

.

it
is
therefore
crucial
to
maintain
or
improve
its
image
of   Prep
doing   Others

.

it
is   Rloc-
relatively
hard
to
deny
how
much
ageing
had
been
made
much
easier
.

in
other
words
,
governments
highly   Wci
appreciate
the
contribution   Nn
of
old   Wci
people   Wci
in   Wci
the   Wci
past   Wci
and
try
to
offer
them
more
but   Srun
the   Srun
budget   Srun
constraint   Srun
calls   Srun
for   Srun
limiting   Srun
in   Srun
order   Srun
to   Srun
develop   Srun
other   Srun
aspects   Srun
of   Srun
society   Srun
.

when
extracted
and
processed
,
enriched
uranium
-   ArtOrDet
can
become
a
key
material
for
the
manufacture
of
nuclear
weapons
.

for
most
countries
,
part
of
their
national
budget
will
be
spent
on   Wci
funding
the
aged
each
year
.

thus
society
should
limit
their
spending
on
the
aged
and
shift
their
focus
onto
the
young
,   Rloc-
nurturing   Rloc-
them   Rloc-
.

however
,
after
major
nuclear
incidents
such
as
the
chernobyl
disaster
,
the
general
public
have
became
skeptical
about
the
safety
of
nuclear

.

automation
throughout
the
reactors
and   Mec
passive
safety
features
are
just
some
of
the
technology
implemented
to
make
the
generation
iv
reactors
safer
.

hence
,
public
spending
should
not
be
limited
,   Srun
in   Srun
fact   Srun
we
should
even   Rloc-
divert
more
funds
to
similar
projects
that
will
cater
to
the
needs
of
an
older
population
as
they
will
after
all
make
up
a
significant
amount   Wci
in

-   Srun
thus
more
focus
should
be
placed
on
them
.

although
the

may
be
minimised
to
develop

there

to   Rloc-
be   Rloc-

is
critical
.

an
example
is
the

(

which

both

as

which
would
prevent
similar
incidents
of   Prep
-   ArtOrDet

.

it
is
just
a   Nn
switch
in
roles
from
governments
to
families
and
individuals
to
shoulder
these
expenses
,
which
most
of
the
case
actually
involved
a

besides
taking
care
for
the

,
there
are
several
other
areas
the   Others
government

put
the

.

particularly
,
the

of

includes
both

which
can

due
to
the

,
a

hence
,
this
shows
that
despite

increase
in

for

it
does
not
mean
that
the
other

hence
,
this
is
where

come
in   Wci
the   Wci

of   Wci
addressing   Wci

people
wonder   Vform
the

when
it
comes
to
the   ArtOrDet

,
every

should

thus

the

in

agree   Wtone
that   Wtone
the   ArtOrDet

have
helped
to

saw   Wtone
a

faces

the

that

in

.

finally
,
all
the
research
and
developments
of
technology
depend
on
economic

.

after
that
,
engineers
have
to
``
gather
pertinent
information
''
to
make
sure
-   Srun
that
this
problem
is
real
by
doing
a
survey
on
the
users
so
that
they
will
not
waste
time
designing
something
that
the
market
does
not
need
.

(

2009
)
for
the
government
of
singapore
to
substantiate
our   Pref
standings
in
the
financial
markets
of
the
world
,
she   Pref
has
to
continue
to
provide

,
coming   Srun
from
the
areas
of
world-class
infrastructures
,
investment
avenues
,
tourism
and
trade
,   Trans
those   Trans
of   Rloc-
which   Rloc-
require
a
sizeable
amount
of
public
spending
,
-   Wci
for
the
experts
in
the
field
to
come
in
.

the
whole
world
would
have
waited
for   WOinc
more   WOinc
decades
to
see
the
discovery
of
penicillin
.

as
nuclear
technology
becomes
so
important
,
it
is
necessary
to
have
an
international
organization
to
supervise
the
process
of
every
country
's
-   Others
development
.

it
is
a
time
when
chinese
government
paid   Vt
huge
sum   Nn
of
money
to
create
good
-   ArtOrDet
investing
environment
and
financially
support
local
entrepreneurs
.

yet
,
no
actions
have   Vform
been   Vform
done   Vform
by
the
company
to
replace
the
failing
wheels
.

the
number
of
immediate
fatalities
from
1970
to
1992
for
nuclear
-   Others
is
31
and
those
for
coal
and
gases   Nn
are
6400
and
1200
respectively
.

from
here
,
we
can
see
that
the
engineering
design
processes
must
be
constantly
be   Rloc-
updated
,
-   Wci
otherwise
more
problems
may
occur
and   Rloc-
this   Rloc-
has   Rloc-
caused   Rloc-
many   Rloc-
engineering   Rloc-
design   Rloc-
process   Rloc-
to   Rloc-
be   Rloc-
abandoned   Rloc-
halfway   Rloc-
and   Rloc-
hence   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
it   Rloc-
is   Rloc-
a   Rloc-
problem   Rloc-
that
may
significantly
hamper
engineering
design
process
for
innovations
.

last
but
not
the
least   Wci
,
is
the
security
.

consequently
,
generation
iv
nuclear
systems
are   Vt
born
,
including   Others
six
models
.

in
the
case
of
iraq
,
satisfying
the
basic
needs
of
-   ArtOrDet
people
is
the
most
important
thing
which
should
be
put
first
.

as
the
aging
problems
are
getting
seriously   Wform
nowadays
,
it
should
not
be
invariably   Rloc-
neglected
by
the
society
but
to
face
the
problem
that
the
elderly
may
suffer
financial
hardships
in
their
golden
age
after
they
-   Vt
retired
.

in   Prep
my
perspective
,
it
may
not
be
practical
-   Srun
especially
for
the   ArtOrDet
developing
countries
with
large
population
.

for
examples   Trans
,
there
are
also
many
-   Others
needy
people
like
orphans
,
the
disabled
or
unemployed
that
want
to
be
subsidized
by
the
government
.

secondly
,
any   Wci
supports   Wci
of
traditional
power
plants
argue
that
the
cost
of
building
nuclear
plants
is
much
higher
than
for   Spar
the   ArtOrDet
coal
plants
.

on   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
other   Rloc-
hand   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
due   Mec
to
the   ArtOrDet
fast-paced
and
stressful
working
environment
nowadays   Rloc-
,
the
elder
generations
would
not
be
motivated
to
extend
their
stay
in
the
workforce
.

hence
,
we
can
conclude
that
automation
can
be
seen
as
a
tool
in
relieving
the
aging
process
that   Rloc-
can   Rloc-
be   Rloc-
beneficial   Rloc-
in   Rloc-
a   Rloc-
long   Rloc-
run   Rloc-
.

engineers   WOinc
should
not
have   WOinc
been   WOinc
over-expected   WOinc
;   Srun
after   Srun
all
,
engineers
are
also
ordinary
people
and
have
limitations   WOinc
of   WOinc
human   WOinc
as
well
.

generation
iv
reactors
may
just
be
the
solution
to
meet
these   SVA
demands
.

secondly
,
biological
change
is
another
-   ArtOrDet
change
that
aging
brings
about
.

however
,
the
rising
standard
of
living
can
cause
some
factors
that
will
contribute
to
the
aging
population
such
as
high-quality
health
care
,
which
helps
people
live
longer
.

instead
,
it
is   Vm
a
must
for
him
to
disclose
his
disease
to
:   Mec
his
spouse
to
save
their
baby
from
inheriting
the
disease
,
-   Spar
his
employer
to
make
sure
that
his
job
is
safe   Others
and
-   Spar
all
people
around
him
-   Spar
.

due
to
the
above
two
problems
,
chinese
engineering   Mec
design
was
harmed
seriously
.

there
is
a
need
for
this
development
as
currently
nuclear
reactors
are
not
that
safe
and
efficient   Spar
.

furthermore
,
besides
ensuring
that
the
elderly
will
have
sufficient
funds
for
their
living
expenses
after
their
retirement
,
the
singapore
government
has   Vt
also   Vt
ensured   Vt
that
the
elderly
will   Vt
be   Vt
able
to
cope
with
the
hefty
and
long
term
medical
expenses
in
their
old
age
through
the
implementation
of
policies
such
as
the
eldershield
(
healthcare
financing
,
eldershield   Cit
)
.

therefore
the
current
problem
singapore
-   V0
facing
now
is
the
aged
population
.

without
proper
knowledge
and
problem-solving
skills
from   Um
psychology   Um
design   Um
,
they   Um
could   Um
not   Um
know   Um
exactly   Um
the   Um
situation   Um
and
behaved
in
a   ArtOrDet
wrong
way
when
problems
appeared
.

car
manufacturers
are
the
next
immediate
culprit
culpable
for
the
continued
devlopment
of
gasoline-powered
vehicles
-   Srun
rather
than
focusing
on
the
environmental   Wform
friendly
electric
car
.

first
of
all
,
engineering
processes
provides   SVA
the
foundation
for
researches   Nn
to
get
a
new
state-of-the-art
design
.

they
have
higher
quantity
of
combustion
,
but
they
are   Vform
not   Vform
reproducible   Vform
and
the
resource
is
limited
.

it
should
,
however
,
be
emphasized
that
the   ArtOrDet
governments
do
pay
attention
to
the
aged
population
and   Um
what   Um
mentioned   Um
here   Um
is   Um
limiting   Um
the   Um
spending   Um
on   Um
this   Um
matter   Um
in   Um
a   Um
reasonable   Um
way   Um
.

however
,
this
is
not
always
true
because
technology
can
overcome
some
obstacles
that
they
faced   Vt
during
the
aging
process
.

for
a
country
-   Srun
spending
in   WOinc
education
is
consider   Wci
as
injecting
-   Others
into
an
economy
-   Srun
whereas
spending
on
the
aged
is
consider   Vt
as
-   V0
a
leakage
in   Prep
an   ArtOrDet
economy
.

an
area
where
psychology
can
be
applied
is
interpersonal
communication
which
is
required
in   Nn
the   Nn
processes
of
engineering
.

no
amount
of
them   Others
is   Vm
meaningful   Wci
.

therefore
,
an
increase
in
social
disparity
and
healthcare
problems
would
be
an
issue
to   Prep
the
country
.

however
,
one
could
question
why
did   WOadv
the   WOadv
terrorists   WOadv
not
fly
the
plane
into
the
twin
reactors
?   Mec

only
if
the
key
players
,
engineers
,
are
-   ArtOrDet
concerned
and
given
due
attention
can
the
world
of
engineering
run
in
the
right
direction
.

therefore
,
if
they
are
in   Vt
need
of
help
,
why
not
just
help
them
?

its
success
is
determined
mainly
by
three
factors
:
company   ArtOrDet
's   ArtOrDet
perception
towards   Prep
the
product
,
economic
factor   Nn
and
social
factor   Nn
.

thus
,
the   ArtOrDet
public
expenditure
of   Prep
on
education
should
never
be
overlooked
.

hence
,
as
-   ArtOrDet

is
a

,
i
predict
a
not   Wci
so   Wci
bright   Wci
future

.

nuclear-related
issue   Nn
has   SVA
always
been
one
of
the
most
important
issues
of   Um
the   Um
contemporary   Um
system   Um
of   Um
justice   Um
.

if
an
individual
discover   Wform
after
a
genetic
test
that
he
has
a
high
risk
of
developing
certain
disease   Wform
,
it
would
mean
that
his
family
member
who
share
similar
genes
may
be
at
risk
as
well
(

.

advocates

that

.

firstly
,
the
majority
of
the
elderly
population
are
often
outdated   Vform
with
the
newer
technologies
,   Trans
most
of
them
are
unable
to

it
is
also
intensively
consumer
focused
and
very
flexible
,   Trans
able
to
adapting   Vt
to
the
needs
and
demands
of
internet
users
quickly
.

for
example
,
five
percent
of
the
population
in
singapore
is
1000
times
lesser   Wform
than
five
percent
of
the
population
in
the   ArtOrDet
china
.

with   Wci
the
elderly
returning
to
the
workforce
they
will
be
able
to
accumulate
more
wealth
and
save
more
so
that
they
will
be
able
to
be
self
sufficient
when
they
are
older
.

in
the
long
run
,
we
are
still
maintaining
our
level
of

thought   Um
a
different
way
.

by

engineers

which

safe
,
efficient
,

,

,
user
friendly
,
manageable
,
durable
and

an
engineer
would
firstly
need
to
define
the

.

as   Um
a   Um

we   Um

not   Um
have   Um

to
ensure
that
there
are
sufficient
funds
for
the
country
's
development
,
public
spending
on
the
age   ArtOrDet
should
be
limited
.

during
the

,
prime
minster
lim
hsien
loong
pointed
out
the
need
to
improve
the
health

system
for
the

.

making   Vform
matters
worse
,
if
the
retirement
costs
and
providing
for
aged
parents
are
added
into
the
equation
,
having
children
will
be
the
last
thing
on
the
couples
'
minds
.

in
general
,
the
justification
of
the
utility
of
a
specific
technology
or
invention
depends
on
the
specific
perspectives   Wci
from   Prep
different
group
of
people
.

safety
issues
involving   Wci
past
nuclear
accidents
still
strikes   SVA
fear
in
the
public
's
heart
.

furthermore
,
the
nutrition
industry
has
also
jumped
in
this
battle
against
-   ArtOrDet
aging
problem
with
milk
and
other
products
like

that

.

as

large
working

retires
,
this
will
mean
that
there
are
less
people
to
work
and
provide
for
the
retired

.

indeed
,
the
above

warrants
a

this

opponents   ArtOrDet
of
surveillance
technology
argue
that
surveillance
technology
invades
privacy
.

since
it
is
much
more
expensive
than
-   ArtOrDet
usually
used
firepower
plant
,
whether
nuclear
power
plant   ArtOrDet
can
provide
electricity
efficiently
with
a
reasonable
cost
became
a
rather
essential
problem
.

therefore
,
to
prevent
over   Mec
dependence   Mec
on
the
government
by   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
children   Rloc-
,
public
spending
should
be
limited
and
be
diverted
to
other
areas
for
better
use
.

at
the
same
time
,
the
technology
to
dig
on
the
moon
,
and
even
use
helium
as
a
fuel
is
still
not
available
yet
.

though
some
may
agree
that
public
spending
on
the
aged
largely
aids
the   ArtOrDet
society
in
coping
with
the
needs
of
an
ageing
population
,
however   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
it
may
-   Trans
hinders
the
development
in
other
sectors
.

before
a
technology
innovation
is
developed
and
patented
,
scientists
have
to
go
through
a
tedious
research
process
most   Vt
of
the
time
.

the
government
has
highlighted
to
the
public
the
importance
and
benefits
of
financial
planning
for
their   Rloc-
old
age
.

though
the
use
of
rfid
technology
has
its
merits
such
as
crime
prevention
,
it
should
still   Cit
be   Cit
barred   Cit
because   Cit
the   Cit
use   Cit
of   Cit
surveillance   Cit
technology   Cit
such   Cit
as   Cit
rfid   Cit
to   Cit
track   Cit
people   Cit
not   Cit
only   Cit
infiltrate   Cit
one
's
privacy
;
it
is
also
not
cost
effective
and
likely
to
result
in
data
theft
and
data
loss
.

however
,
large
scale
setup
of
barriers
and
tuxedos
lookalike
safety
suit
might
not
be
feasible
as
they
increases   SVA
the
cost
significantly
and
limits   SVA
its
actual
functionality
.

they
also
do
not
care
whether
this
-   V0
knowledge
is
right
or
wrong
.

however
,
there
are
arguments
that
are
against
the   SVA
use
of
rfid
technology
in
monitoring
and
tracking
people
and
animals
despite
the
benefits
gained
.

individual   Nn
that
may
inherit
genetically   Wform
disease   Nn
should
-   Others
choose

that
are
beyond
their
reach
.

thus
,
rfid
can
be
use   Vform
to
track
a
child
as
it
can
prevent
kidnapping
.

just
what
is
surveillance
technology
?

so
,   Vt
my
stand
as
a
reviewer
is
that
tata
's
nano
lacks
safety
.

on
the
contrary
,
excessive
public
spending
can
also
-   ArtOrDet
hinder
the
development
of
a
country
too
.

this
could   Vt
be
explained
because
in
order
to
determine
the
most
possible
solution
in
engineering
design
process
,
we
have
to
conduct
many
experiments
and
these
experiments
require
materials
in   Wci
which
money
must
be
injected
into
the
project
.

their
efforts
should
be
compensated
when
they
are
old
by
providing
-   Wci
suitable
assistance
scheme
through
public
spending

tracing
back
to
the   Prep
late
1970s
,
electronic
data
interchange
and
electronic
funds
transfer
first
emerged
in
the
us
to
satisfy
people
's
needs
for
simple
business
communication
.

defining
it
would
include
a
refining
of
the
question
at
hand
to
a
more
straight
forward
one
.

if
we
fail
to
limit
the   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on
the
aged
,
the
pressure
is
likely
to
have
an
effect
on
public
spending
for
other
priorities
,
and
also
affect
economic
growth
.

there
are
other
contributing
factors
such
as
the
efforts
of
the
inventors
and
their
determinations   SVA
to
succeed
that
lead   Vt
to
the
discovery
of
the
technology
.

in
all   Trans
,
with
the
help
of
advancing   Wform
technologies
,
the
elderly
can
counter
their
shortfalls   Rloc-
in   Rloc-
sight
and
hearing
loss
and
thus   Rloc-
still   Rloc-
live
independently
without   Rloc-
much   Rloc-
intervention   Rloc-
from   Rloc-
family   Rloc-
members   Rloc-
or   Rloc-
others   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
especially   Rloc-
when   Rloc-
there   Rloc-
is   Rloc-
nobody   Rloc-
at   Rloc-
home   Rloc-
.

for
example
,
when
somebody
or
some
companies
want
to
apply
new
techniques
into
practice
,
in
some
certain
situations
,
they
had   Vt
to
ask
the
government
for
permissions   Npos
.

in
addition
,
the   ArtOrDet
additional
healthcare
resource   Nn
can
improve
the
health
of
the
elderly
hence
,
enhancing
the
productivity
of
the
aged
.

there
is
not
much
more   Rloc-
that
the
government
need   SVA
to
spend
on
developing
the
nation
.

there
are
technologies
whereby   Wci
they   Wci
can   Wci
enable
the
elderly
to
look
younger

in

long
run

it

been   Vt

more
important

the

has
selected
six
nuclear

which
have
the
potential
to
be
used
as   Prep
commercial
electricity
generator   Wform
and
in
my
opinion
,
the
supercritical-water-cooled
reactor
(
scwr
)
and
the
very
high
temperature
reactor
(
vhtr
)
are
the
better
ones
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
reactors
.

it
was
disturbing
to
shaking   Wform
a
fan
at
work
or
in   Prep
sleep
.

they
no   Vform
need
to
worry
the   WOinc
discrimination   WOinc
about   WOinc
any
more
.

besides
,
focus
could
also
be
placed
upon
the   ArtOrDet
education
for
the
younger
generation
.

for
example
,
britain
spends
more
on
their   Pref
ageing
population
as
compared
to
america
and
their   Pref
level
of
investment
in
research
and
development
is
lower
than
that
of
america
.

all
the
research
and
funding
for
the
vhtr
is   ArtOrDet
definitely
worth
the
money
and
effort
with
regards
to
the
security
issue
of
nuclear
power
plant   Nn
(

information

.

nevertheless
,
taking   Wci
this   Wci
situation   Wci
from   Wci
another   Wci
point   Wci
of   Wci
view   Wci
actually
aligns
with
the
government
's
aim
:
fostering
mutual
care
between
the
young
and
elderly
.

the
situation
is
similar
for
the
problem
of
aging
population
.

scientists
from
these
countries
cooperate
to
get   Wci
the   Wci
development   Wci
of   Wci
the
next
generation
of
nuclear
technology
,
the
generation
iv
nuclear
reactor
(
world
nuclear
association
,
2008
)
.

the   Wtone
aged   Wtone
are   Wtone
parents   Wtone
to   Wtone
our   Wtone
children   Wtone
and   Wtone
we   Wtone
share   Wtone
the   Wtone
roots   Wtone
of   Wtone
human   Wtone
hierarchy   Wtone
.   Wtone

in
malaysia
,
the   ArtOrDet
corruption
in   Prep
the
politic   Mec
system
has
leads   Vt
to
slow
development
in
design
process   Wform
.

however
,
there
comes   SVA
some
controversies
-   Trans
that
the
vhtr
requires
very
complicated
technologies
and
very
high
cost
construction
compared
to
the
sodium
cooled
fast
reactor
.

so
during
the
process
,
they
encounter
different
obstacles
,
such
as
political
issues
,
-   Trans
financial
issues
.

however
,
gasoline
vehicles
are
still
higher   Wci
in
demand
as
compared
to
non   Mec
gas   Mec
emission
vehicles
,
electric
vehicles
.

one
of
the
reasons
is
that
normal
employees
are
not
inspirited   Um
to
take
part
in
the
innovation
.

public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
,   Mec
which   Rloc-
may   Rloc-
suffer   Rloc-
the   Mec
aged
-   V0
but
we
can
not
spend
all
out   Rloc-
-   ArtOrDet
money
on
the
elderly
,
especially
when
it
will
not
bring
the   ArtOrDet
long-term
benefit   Nn
.

the
retirement
savings
are
important
to
plan
in
advance
for
the
benefits
of
the
elderly   Wci
and   Wci
they
are
encouraged
to
save
for
the
retirement
savings
,
medical
savings
and
expenses
.

for   Prep
most
of   Prep
people
,   Wci
they   Wci
just   Wtone
worry
about
the
uncertainty   Wform
effects
of
gm
food
.

(
nuclear
-   ArtOrDet
vs.
coal
,
2007
)
the
cost
for
coal
and
nuclear
energies
are
generally
comparative
,
$
300/mw-hr
for
nuclear
energy
and
$
29.1/mw-hr
for
coal
respectively
.

in
summary
,
this
accident
could
have
been
prevented
right
from
the
beginning
,
taking
human
errors
into
considerations   Nn
in
the
design
phase
.

public
spending
on
the
aged
should
fluctuate
according
to
the
composition
of
the
old-aged   Rloc-
citizens
within
the
population
of
singapore
.

if
we
do
not
put
enough
effort
to
solve
the
problem
right
now
,
it
will
be
a
really   Wtone
big   Wtone
issue
in
the
future
.

the
construction
of
vhtr
is
to
totally
replace
the
conventional
sources   Mec
of   Mec
energy
in
order
to
benefit
the
human
population
.

government   Nn
and
policy
maker   Nn
have
to
decide
on   Prep
what
is
essential
and
should
be
supported
by
-   ArtOrDet
public
sector
.

it
is
often
argued
that
the
scwr
is
rather   Nn
safe
in
comparison
with
other
generation
iv
reactor
concepts
because
it
operates
at
rather
low
temperature
,
ranging
from
510
to
550°c
(
butler
,
2004
)
.

recently
,
there
have
also
been
top-ups
provided
to
their
cpf
accounts
to
further
help
them
meet
their
retirement   Wci
needs
.

thus
,
luck
is
required   Rloc-
at
every
successful
experiment
,
let
alone
serendipity
,
which
requires
more
luck
to
achieve
another
result
to
just
meet
a
certain
kind
of
people
's
need
coincidentally

according
-   ArtOrDet
to
one
study
,
20-25
percent
of
the

but
for

,
the
physical

varies   SVA
greatly
from

,
and
is

on
the

's

,
the
surrounding

another
policy
introduced
by

is
to
encourage
-   ArtOrDet

to
work

on

has
proved
that
when

they
tend

a
result

the

however
,
one
might

they

they

this

highlights
the
importance   Rloc-
of   Rloc-
spending   Rloc-
on   Rloc-
the

to
ensure
that
they
continue

of
course
,
it   ArtOrDet
is   Vm
not   Vm
possible
.

to
sum
up
,
the
spending
on
the
aged
should
not
be
limited   Wci
as
it
spurs
economic
growth
and
prepares
the
healthcare
industry
to
combat
this
pressing
issue
.

without
that
-   Others
,
the
elderly
may
start
and   Others
spend
time
reflecting
-   Others
their
past
,
remembering
disappointment   Nn
and
that
stage
of
life
may
turn
into
a
time
of
despair
and
loneliness

with
only
little
positive
meaning
in

in
conclusion
,
the
elderly
nowadays
are
being
helped
a
lot
with
different
advances
in
technology
,
-   Trans
become
more
and
more
independent
-   Trans
to
live
on
their
own
.

the
technological
advancement
in
medical
science
-   ArtOrDet
will
be
discussed
to
address
some
of
the
issues
mentioned

we   Wtone
may   Wtone
wonder   Wtone
why   Wtone
this   Wtone
tendency   Wtone
happens   Wtone
these   Wtone
years   Wtone
.   Wtone

the
statistics
have
shown
that
in
time
to
come
,
the   SVA
problems
of
a
fast
aging
population
will
be
too
overwhelming
for
the
society
to
handle
,
therefore
we
have
to
slow
down
the
aging
process
.

interestingly
,
aid
for
the
aged
in   Prep
their
psycho-social
needs
is
still
lacking
.

therefore
,
improvement
in
healthcare
services
for
the
elderly
is   Rloc-
essential
.

although
,   Mec
some
technological
problems
still
exist
,
nuclear
power
energy
,
as
one
of
the
further   Others
energy   Others

will
surely
get   Wci
more

without

it

be

for

emergent   Wform
of

i
personally
support

in

compared

a

one

thus   Srun
it

produce

which
means
less
core
material
such
as
uranium   Mec
would
be
consumed
to
produce
-   ArtOrDet
same
quantities
of
electricity
.

then
the
process
and
product
would
be
more
environmental   Wform
friendly
.

as
far
as
the   ArtOrDet
radioactive
waste
is
concerned
,
-   ArtOrDet
lead-cooled

is
designed
best
to
cut
back
on

for

,

would   Vt
become
an

their

as
such
,
with
the
different
types
of
facilities
and
medical
developments
available
,
the
elderly
no
longer
has   SVA
to
suffer
in
silence
.

in
other
words
,
it
is
highly
friendly
to
the
environment
.

there
are
better
methods
of
using
this
sum
of
money
collected
from

from
its
people
to
solve

disposal
problem
.

these
occurrences
may
seem
common
now
,
but
they
were
definitely
not
in
the
early
1900s
.   Nn

this
is
to
ensure
that
the
future
batch   Vt
of
elderly
are
well-prepared
for
their
own
ageing
process
and
not
just
wait
for
the
government
to
take
care
of
them
.

this   Wci
may   Wci

true   Wci

such

solar

tidal

or
wind
energy
,
and
their

advantages
and
drawbacks
.

while

spending
on

is
vital
,
it
should
not
comprise
the   ArtOrDet
other
aspects
of
the   ArtOrDet
country
's
growth
and
development
.

in
conclusion
on   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
whole   Rloc-
,
society
should
now
move
toward
a
new
paradigm
that   Ssub
aging

not   Wci
equate   Wci
to   Wci
burdensome   Wci
on

or
-   ArtOrDet
development
of

taking   Vform

this
is
very
crucial
as
to
ensure
that
the

and
the
efficiency
of

are   Wci
kept
to

therefore
,
in
modern

,
engineering
has
become

important
;
the
role   Rloc-
of   Rloc-
an
engineer
is
to
design
a

a

that
minimizes

brings

if

in

round
,
the
parent

may
not   ArtOrDet
be
lesser
than

's

in

(

as
well
as

.

as
a
result
,
there
is
a
decrease
in
efficiency
as
it
is
being
used
many   Prep
times
and
loses
its
capability
to
generate
the

intyre
(

once
said
that

all

this   Wci

however
,
in

where
there
are
no

nuclear

seems
to
be
the
most
suitable
energy
for

and
therefore
one
of
the
generation
iv

,
-   ArtOrDet
lead-coaled

should
be

as
the
most   Wci

did

before
going
into
further
investigation
,
it
is
important   Vform
to
bear
this
in
mind
that
aging
process
is
not
as
simple
as
longevity
,
but
associated
with
one
's
ability
to
contribute
to
the
society
and
participate
in
various
social
activities
.

despite
the
fact
that
many
people
approve
the
idea
of
unlimited
budget
for
the
old
,
it
would
be
better
to
set
a

to

governments
'
expenses
in   Rloc-
this   Rloc-
problem   Rloc-
for
some   Wci
reasons
.

long
term
illness
such
as
diabetes
is
more
effectively
controlled
,
and
the
treatment
process
has
become   Wci
less   Wci
painful
.

these
questions
proved
to
be
contentious
and
controversial
and
i
will
be
further
expanding
these
ideas   Prep
through
this
paper
.

with
an
increase
in
the

an

we

we
also
need

,   Rloc-

in

met   Vt
with   Prep
many
significant
difficulties

as
we

the   Um
ability   Um
to   Um
have   Um
chronically
ill
patients
need
to
check
in
with
a
health-care
provider
every
day
and
answer
questions
about
their
current
symptoms
allows   Wform
for
immediate
intervention
.

moreover
,
nuclear
power
system
is
much
-   Others
more
secure
than
other
energy
resource
systems
.

time
is
running
out
and
to
protect
the
sustainability
of
life
on
earth
,
necessary
actions
have
to
be
taken
immediately
-   Trans
if
not
,
as
soon
as
possible
-   Mec
and
the
help
of
engineering
design
processes
should
not
be
left
out
.

in
addition
,
the
limitation   Nn
of
electronic
dictronary   Nn
,
such
as
no   Wci
access
to
the
the
internet
,
also
determines   SVA
that
the
price
of
electronic
dictronary
-   Trans
can
not
be
too
high
.

another
significant
performance
of
the
very
high
temperature
is
that
it
can
generate
hydrogen
from
water
,
which
can
be
used
in
seawater
desalination   Srun
.

many
may
argue
that
the
elderly
are
also
equally
,
if
not
,
more
in
need
of
the
funds
,
especially
since
they
were
once
economically
active   Srun
,   Srun
it   Srun
's   Srun
only
right
that
their

is
being
taken

now
that

have
lost

the
common
challenges
faced
by
every   ArtOrDet
developed
and
developing
countries
are
the
daily
demands
for
improvement
in
various
areas
,
be
it
economy
,
infrastructure
or
even
society
.

therefore
,
the
use
of
surveillance   SVA
technology
such
as
rfid
to
track
people
should
be
banned
as
it
threatens
the
welfare
of
individuals
.

since
the
cost
of
fossil
fuel
is
soaring
high
now
,
if
we
still
continue

,
we
would
have
to
pay
a
very
high
electricity
cost
when   Rloc-
compared
to
-   Spar
nuclear
energy
.

in
conclusion
,
the   ArtOrDet
vhtr
is
still
one
of
the
better
choices
when
compared
to
the   ArtOrDet
msr
.

the
problem
starts
form   Mec
here
.

building
of   Prep
additional
housing
and
infrastructures   Nn
would
cost
a
huge
amount
of
money
.

however
,
in
term   Wci
of
the
overall
development
cost
,
the
very
high
temperature
reactors   SVA
is
still
much
cheaper
than
the
molten
salt
reactor
.

the
use
of
high
temperature
creates
an
extremely
volatile
and
sensitive
situation
which
-   Mec
on
-   ArtOrDet
one
hand
raises
output
efficiency
(
oecd
nuclear
energy
agency
,
2000
)
,
but
also
requires
a
precise
state-of-the-art
monitoring
system
that
further
increases
the
production
prices
.

this
issue
has
led
to
a
heated
debate
on
whether
we   Srun
should
limit
the
spending
of
public
funds
on
the
aged
.

however
,
such   Others
decisions   Others
only
have
short-term
benefits
and
fail
to
consider
the
bigger
picture
such
as
situations
-   Wci
which
one
's
family
eventually
discovers
one
's
secret
.

nuclear

therefore

in

development

hence

countries   Vform
should

leaders

there

one
of

implication   Pform
is
that
the

as

engineering

are   Vt
hampered
at   Prep

(

thus
-   ArtOrDet
individual
of
known
genetic
risk
should
be
obligated
to
reveal
test
results
to
relatives
because
it
brings
awareness
concerning

disease
to
the
foreground
,
not
only
to
the
person
tested
,
but
for
his
or
her
relatives
as
well
.

the
following
ideas
are
what
i
speculate
on
transferring   Others
in
the
future
:
the
first
step
is
to
store
the
information
of
the
people
,
more   Trans
generally   Trans
,   Trans
is   Trans
to
break
up

human

and
make   ArtOrDet
a   ArtOrDet
rearrangement   ArtOrDet
of   ArtOrDet

particles

from
kitchen
appliances
like
refrigerator
to
home
entertainment
systems
,
these
are
things
which
we
often
take
them   Rloc-
for
granted
.

the
serendipitous
discovery
of
new
ideas
therefore   Trans
,
sometimes
comes
out
during
the
trials
.

in
addition
to
the
improvement
of
facilities
in
the
current
agriculture   Wform
system
,
high-tech
support
also
plays
a
crucial
role
in
increasing
food
production
.

first
is
the   Nn
choice
for
the
coolant
.

it
will
only
create
a   Wci
reliance
on
the
government
.

however
,
the
use
of
hydrogen
tanks
in
vehicles
,
and
in
particular
the
challenge
of
using
very   Vt
high   Vt
pressures
,
require
advanced
technology
.

to
prevent
the
disruption
of
-   ArtOrDet
labour
market
,
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
are
likely
to
remain
in
the
work
force
in
the
near
future
.

limiting
public
-   Others
is
something
which
the   SVA
governments
must
consider
seriously
.

fortunately
,
mizoguchi
's
product
caught
the
eyes
of
the
senior
vice
president
of
-   ArtOrDet
toshiba
europe
and
thus
he
offered
to
sell
ten
thousand
laptops
in
a
year
.

to
sum
up
,
surveillance
technology
should
not
be
banned
as
its
usefulness
in
-   ArtOrDet
workplace
and
enhancing   Spar
public
safety
makes   SVA
it
an
indispensable

we

it
is   Vt
also   Vt
suggested
that

harsh

of
inheriting
a
genetic

may
create
an
emotional
impact
,
especially
when
disclosed
despite
the
patient

reluctance

however
,
this
argument
ignores   Wci
the
fact
that
terrorism
will
be
around
regardless
of
whether

are

therefore
we
can
see
those   Ssub

are
only
encouraged
to
greater   Rloc-
explore
and
express
their
creativity
during
their
tertiary

take
china
as
-   Wci
example
;   Mec
there
are
two
main
problems
in   Prep
hampering
the
development
of
innovation
.

according
to
rogers
(
2003   Vt
)
,
skunkwork
refers
to
a
small
group
of
highly
selected
people
designated
to
do
research
for
an
innovation
without
carry
out
tedious
organization
procedures
.

this
issue
particularly
affects
innovations
that
are
on
the   ArtOrDet
larger
scale
,
as
large
cost   Nn
will
be
incurred
in
the
construction
of
its   Pref
foundations
.

because
engineering   Mec
designs
are
always
related
to
real
problem   Nn
,
during
the
five
processes
,
the
obstacles
they
face
are
more
than
theories
and
calculations
on
paper
.

in
2000-2001
,
seniors
accounted
for
43
percent
of
total
health
care
spending
but
represented
only
12.5
percent
of
the
population
.

it
is
highly
notable
that
since
chenobyl
incident
there
is   Vt
no
more
any   ArtOrDet
accident
.

therefore
,
it
is
necessary   Nn
for
the
government
to
review
the
public
policies
for
the
elderly
.

after
the
accident
,
people
tried
to
figure   Wtone
out   Wtone
what
are   Vt
the
reasons
that
caused
the
malfunction   Wform
of
the
power
plant
.

it
is
because
rfid
is
able
to
efficiently
detect
terrorists
and
criminals
who
hide
drugs
in
their
bodies
,
all
objects
made
by   Prep
mental   Mec
,
all
explosive

so

in

,

a
higher
income
will
allow

to
support

better
and
therefore
provide

,
allowing   WOinc
the   WOinc

to   WOinc
spend
less

however
,
the

had
not

the

inside

actually
increase

radiation
atoms
at   Prep
the

this
is
because
they
will
miss
out
-   Wci
the
opportunities
to

to
the
large
database
of

,
goods

but
as
for

,
the
resources
it
uses
may
not
be
readily
available
,
so
it
-   Pref
will
not
be
very
convenient
.

in
an
era
which   Pform
the
scale
of
our
industrial
system
is
growing
larger
and
larger
,
the
consumption
of
resource   Nn
becomes
an

and
people
start
to
suffer
the

for   Srun
the
destruction
and
pollution
we
have
done
to
the
environment
,
a
series
of
social
issues
concerning
engineering
and
environment
have
been
raised
.

moreover
,
it
is
more
economic   Wform
to
develop
msrs
.

therefore
,
with   WOinc
the   WOinc
cpf   WOinc
scheme   WOinc
created   WOinc
by   WOinc
the   WOinc

it   WOinc

financial

they

not

.

health   ArtOrDet
sector
would
be
one
of
the
areas
where
help
is
needed
for
the
aged
due
to
the
rising
medical
expenditure
,   Ssub
thus   Ssub
not   Ssub
being   Ssub
fair
to
burden
them
with
the
entire
cost
.

in
this
way
,
the
children
will
have
more   Wci
financial
allowance   Wci
to
take
care
of
the   ArtOrDet
parents
.

therefore
,
mostly   WOadv
these   WOadv
health   WOadv
care   WOadv
centres   WOadv
are   WOadv
located
to   Prep
the   ArtOrDet
places
where
a
high
proportion
of
older
people
are
staying
.

due
to
the
lack
in   Prep
fund   Nn
,   Nn
there
is
money
to
hire
research
engineering
,
research
equipment
and
materials
on
experiment
.

thus
,
-   ArtOrDet
individual
should
decide
what
is
best
for
him
.

however
,
the
use
of
rfid
in
tracking
people
has
brought
about
many   Nn
controversies   Nn
.

for
the

the

infringing

still
exists

the
government
could
offer
scholarships
or
offer

school

based
on
their

in
order
to

to
generate
more

that
the
effects

not

older

tend
to
work

also
require
more

in
addition
,
encouraging

proved
to
ease

to
be

in

main

hampered   Rloc-
are
the
lack
of

and   Trans
there
are
still
a
lot
of
aspects
that
contribute
to

well

however
,
once
the
basis   Mec
infrastructure
has
been
laid
down

nuclear
power
turns
in   Mec
to   Mec
a
readily

cheaply
recoverable
source
of
energy

with

by

of

refrigerator
into
the

potential   Wci

of   Wci

,
there
is
an
ideal
substitute
for

electric

-   Srun
gas
refrigerator
,
which
has
a
quieter
operation
and
longer
use
duration
(
cowan   Cit

cited
by   Cit

)
.

in
my
own
opinion
,
i
agree
with
the
latter
,
for
these   ArtOrDet
following
reasons
.   Mec

however
,
being
likely
to
face
discrimination
from
society
,
individuals
should
also
have
the
choice
to   Mec
conceal   Mec
the
information
from
others
.

on
the
other
hand
,
supporters
of
surveillance
technology
state
that
surveillance
technology
plays
an
important
role
in
crime
detection
and
prevention
thus
maintaining
the
country
's   Wform
security
and
prevent
terrorist
attacks
.

if
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
do
not
have
enough
savings
to   Rloc-
support   Rloc-
,
they
may
depend
financially   Rloc-
on
the
government
or
their
children
.

the
british
government
was
-   ArtOrDet
very
worried
about
this
condition
.

as   Rloc-
stated   Rloc-
from   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
source   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
``
eldershield
is
an
affordable

scheme
which
provides
basic
financial
protection
to

especially
during

''

for
example
,
in   Prep
april

2009
-   Mec
when

(   Rloc-

companies   Nn
)   Rloc-
announced
-   ArtOrDet
positive
preclinical
results
for
the   Rloc-
delivery   Rloc-
of   Rloc-
an
enhanced
influenza
vaccine
,   Srun
adding   Srun
that
the
technology
should
also
work

to
£21.75
(

)
(
brady
huggett
,

)
.

in
order
to
solve
this
problem
,
the
government
have   SVA
implemented
certain
policies
to
aids   Vt
the
aged
,   Mec
some   Mec
of
the
policies
are
the
introduction
of
the
central
provident
funds
,
tax
reliefs
and
the
public
housing
scheme
.

in
such
-   ArtOrDet
situation
,
time
is
of
essence
.

generally
,
the
engineering
design
process
consists
mainly
of
the
five
procedures
mentioned
by
khandani
(
2005
)
which
includes
defining
the
problem
,
gathering
the
relevant
information
,
think   Spar
of
solutions
to
the
problem
,
analyze   Spar
and
select   Spar
one
solution
,
and
test   Spar
it
out
by
implementing
it
.

in
fact
,
several
countries
have
already
implemented
means
testing
systems
that
reflects   SVA
the
above
idea
.

the
key
difference
in
these
two
products
is
the
support
they
received
during
the
creation
process
.

on
top
of
this
,
the
education
system
in
singapore
does   WOinc
not   WOinc
emphasise
on
creativity
.

the   ArtOrDet
public   ArtOrDet
spending
is
,   Mec
thus
needed
to
rectify
the
perception
shaped
by
the
children
,
or
else
the
problem
will
remain
unsolved
.

in
conclusion
,
the
creation
of
electric   Wform
generated
vehicle
can
reduce
air
pollution
problem   Nn
that
is
becoming
more
and
more
serious
nowadays
.

longer
life
expectancy
and
-   ArtOrDet
continuous
falling   Wci
population
have
caused
the
aging
population
in
singapore
to
increase
.

as   Ssub
a   Ssub
consequence   Ssub
,   Ssub
the   Ssub
hot   Ssub
exhaust   Ssub
gas   Ssub
leaked   Ssub
through   Ssub
the   Ssub
joint   Ssub
and   Ssub
burned
everything
up
.

money
is
spent
to
adopt
the
change
to
meet
the
current
technology
.

at
the
same
time
,
volunteers
can
play
a
part
in
helping
to   Rloc-
treat   Rloc-
as
listeners
.

the
approaches
that
countries
usually
adopt   WOinc
to   WOinc
solve
the
aging
issue
include
the
prolonging
of
working
lives
of
the
elderly
and
the
provision
of
an
array
of
welfare
pension
schemes
for
them
.

thus
,
it
not
only
eliminates
danger
for
those   Wci
elderly
people
,
but
also
reduces
the
worrying   Wform
time   Wform
and
effort
for
their
families
.

studies   Um
have   Um
shown   Um
that   Um
the   Um
vhtr   Um
is   Um
able   Um
to   Um
produce   Um
up   Um
to   Um
600mwt   Um

27   Um
times   Um
larger   Um
compared   Um
to   Um
msr   Um
with   Um
22mwt   Um
.   Um

in
addition
,
vhtr
would
be
able
to
function
without
the
need
of   Trans
reprocessing   Wform
plutonium
waste
.

take
for
example
the
housing
in
singapore
,
which
comprises
mainly
of   Prep
housing
development
board
[
hdb
]
flats
.

however
-   Mec
since
the
benefits
reaped
from
surveillance
technology
overpowers   Wci
the
inconvenience
it
results
in
,
surveillance
technology
should
indeed
be
used
to
track
people
.

since
the
prime
minister
had
already
envisaged
a
need
to
create
a
better
living
environment
for
singaporeans
,
so   Rloc-
why
not
we
lessen   Wci
the
spending
on
the
aged
and
invest
it
on
realising
this
wonderful
concept
?

in
the
past
,
it
is   Vt
used
to
track
equipments   Nn
and
data
and
this
does   Vt
not
create
much
controversy
in   Wci
the
issue
of
privacy
.

the
elderly
in
singapore
are
dependent
on
government
subsidies
in
various
areas
due
to
high
cost
of
-   ArtOrDet
living
in
present
society
.

this
is
due
to
its
ability
of   Vform
operating   Vform
at
higher
pressure
and
temperature
(
at
550
degree
celsius
)
with   Prep
a
single
phase
operation
,
unlike
the
current
lwrs
that
need
recirculation
of
heat
and
components
like
jet
pumps
and
steam
generators
.

by
living
a
healthier
life
,
the
elderly
people
can
live
their
days
more
normally
and
hence
-   SVA
help
them
to   Wci
ease   Wci
the
aging
process
.

therefore
,
it
is
not
true
to
say
that
the   ArtOrDet
working
adults
bear
a
heavier
burden
from
supporting
their
parents
when   Trans
government
incentives
are
provided
.

an   Others

collapse
,
tan
(

)
claimed
that
investigations
showed
the
collapse
was
due
to
under
design
made
by
the
engineers
,
shoddy
workmanship
and
cost
cutting
made
by
the
contractors
(
tan
,
1999
)
.

on
the
other
hand
,
senior
activity
centres
are
also
developed
in
housing
estate   Nn
to
encourage
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
-   Vt
remain
integrated
in

.

lastly
,
filial
obligation
is
also
one
of   Nn
the
methods
to
decrease
the
negative
impact
of
fast-aging
population
.

while
the
idea
of
improving
education
to
ease
the
aging
problem
in
the
future
is
workable
,
there
may
still
be
a
problem
of
individuals
who
will
not
be
able
to
follow   Um
this   Um
plan   Um
.

however
,
these
aesthetic
procedures
are
costly
and
usually
not
subsidised
by
the
government
.

as
the   ArtOrDet
living
conditions
improve
and
technology
advances
,
people
are
able
to
lead
a
healthier
lifestyle
and
live
longer
as
compared
to
the
past
.

the
difference
between
a   ArtOrDet
serendipitous
discovery   Nn
and
a   ArtOrDet
researched
technology   Nn
are
the
-   Wci
resources
invested
in

and   Um
how   Um
the   Um
technology   Um
is   Um
gauged   Um
to   Um
be   Um
a   Um
success   Um
.

another
impact
is
the
sustainability
of
families
,
because
there
is   SVA
far
less
children
supporting
far
more
elderly
.

we
measure
performance
by
what   Rloc-
is   Rloc-
the
output
that   Wci
the
system
can   Rloc-
produce   Rloc-
and
the
amount
of
power
it
can
generate
.

however
,
since
to
ensure
safety
is
the
primary
goal
of
msr
,
it
has
good
safety
factors   Wci
.

in
addition
to
their
past
contributions
,
the

are
likely
to
be
able
to
continue
contributing
to
the
society
,
by
-   ArtOrDet
simply
passing
on
their
wealth
of

or
adding

in
conclusion

i   Wtone
feel   Wtone
that   Wtone
public

the   Srun

the

leading   Srun
to

today

helium
should
be
very
stable

inert

so
this

according

,
the

in

of

both

with

be
discovered

public

the

that

suffice
to
say
,
limiting
public
spending
on
the
elderly
must
be
considered
in
order
to
maintain
a
sustainable
economy
.

if
doctors
use
organs
which
are
obtained
by
stem
cells
,
many
technical
problems
can
be
solved
,
like
rejection
reaction
and
the   Wci
shortage
problem   Rloc-
.

to
conclude
,
it
would
be
very
wise
of
the
government
to   Ssub
limit   Ssub
its
spending
on
the
aging
,
and
to
divert
the
money
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

for
example
,
japan
's
phone
companies
have   Vt
actually
offer
phone
models
which
have
bigger
screens
and
larger
font
sizes
,
enhanced
audibility
and
easier-
to-operate
keys
to
attract
the
elderly
.

if
we
look
a
little
deeper
into
the
causes
that
lead
to
the
opposite
solution
,
we
will
find
that
the
focus
that
specific
group   Nn
of
people
pays   SVA
attention
to
is
,
obviously
,
quite
different
from
each
other
.

some
criticize   Wci
ferociously   Wtone
that
such
mass
surveillance
is
the
step
towards
the
totalitarian
world
described
in
jorge
orwell
's
1984.they
fear
the
fictional
orwellian
may
even
become
true
,
which
will
be
a
disaster
for
human
beings
.

secondly
,
the
controllability
of
the   WOinc
both   WOinc

short

and
long
-   Others
effects
of
lsd
and
risperidone
varies   SVA
greatly
.

besides
,
people
who
usually
do
gymnastic   Nn
will
live
longer
and
healthier
than
those
do
not
.

as
torgny
and
wilcke
states   SVA
,
information
can
allow
a
relative
who
has
considerably
increased
risk
of
a
disease
from
smoking
to
make
her
own
decisions
about
smoking
and
take
precautions
when
deciding
on
a
career
which
are   SVA
needful
to
have
a
positive
impact
on
her
future
.

operating
at
lower
pressures
reduces
accident
risk

the   Rloc-
current   Rloc-
lwr   Rloc-
and
fission   Um
products   Um
have   Um
better   Um
retention   Um
in
the
event
of
an

.

despite
challenges
within
steps
of
the
nuclear
fuel
cycle
that   Rloc-
do   Rloc-
exist   Rloc-
,
it   Pform
can
be
solved
with
improvements
in
technology
and
with
global
cooperation
.

in
order
to
benefit
whose   Mec
who
needs   Vform
help
more
,
subsidy
for
hospitalization
in
public
hospital   Nn
has
been
adjusted
so
that
60
percent
of
workers
are
able
to
enjoy
full
subsidy
for
type
c
and
b2
wards
whereas
those
have
higher
earning
power
will
receive
substantial
subsidies
for
both
c
and
b2
class
wards
(

.

therefore
the
implementation
of
the
vhtr
can
offer
a
wide
range
of   ArtOrDet
solution
to
the
fuel
crisis
that
is
currently
troubling
the
public
.

an   Others
elder   Others
is   SVA
a
valuable
asset
if
we
know
how
to
make
use
of
their
strengths
and
not
focus
on
their
weakness

government
policies
and
the
restructuring
of
the
healthcare
system
have
helped   Wci
the
aged
cope
better

therefore
,
firstly
,
money
should
be
diverted
into   Prep
the
economic
sector
,
namely   Wci
stimulation
of
the
domestic
economy
.

in
the
end
,
the
locals
will
still
suffer
from
poverty
and   Srun
remain
unemployed
while
foreign
talent
will
have
numerous
jobs
to
choose
from
.

unlike
china
who
has
abundance
in
labour
,
singapore
on   SVA
the
other
hand
has
little
natural
resources
and
is
unable
to
compete
with
china
on
a
large
scale
.

thus
it
translates
to
higher
electrical
production
efficiency
meaning
that
it
can
produce   Nn
more
electrical
energy
.

this
substantially
supports
that
with   Rloc-
surveillance   Rloc-
technology   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
it   Rloc-
does
not
reduce
the
crime
rate
and
enhances   Vform
public
security
.

healthy   ArtOrDet
body
is
important
because
when
the
eldery
is   SVA
healthy
,
they
will
not
feel
useless
or
abandoned
.

under
this
act
,
the
minimum
retirement
age
in
singapore
is
62
years
-   Others
,
-   Ssub
thus
allowing
them   Others
to
stay
longer

to
sum
up
,
even
though
the
aging
issue
is
quite
difficult
to
handle
,
but   Rloc-
still   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
public

if

it

about

with

with

these

such

most

secondly

this

therefore
it

while

it

inadequate

this

thus
they

be
able
to
participate
more
actively
in

and
they
will
not
feel

the

but
the

nuclear

the

one
of

reasons
for

is
due   Rloc-
to   Rloc-

it
can
not
be
denied
-   Others
the
cost
of

reactor
-   Others
is
very
high
,
but
according
to
the
economics
of

(

,
in

in

the

cost
for

while
the
cost
of

was
8.51cents
.

besides
,
the
thick
fog
formed   Rloc-
worsened
the
situation
.

since
-   ArtOrDet
large
amount
of
money
is
needed
to
support
an

population
,
governments
have
to
increase
their

-   Trans
i
believe
that
the

of

used

far
outweigh
the

'
disadvantages
and
thus
it
should
not

in

,
the

who
belong

are
not
the

who
are
most
vulnerable
to

the

even
in   Rloc-
today
when
the

advanced

the

is

quite
high

at
the

times   Nn
,   Nn
there
are   Vt
many   ArtOrDet
evidences
show
that
nuclear

could
be
considered
as
the

suggestion
to

in

it

in
my
point

support

farther   Wci
research
on
msr
technology
to
fulfill
human
's   Nn
energy
consumption

after
knowing

possible

one
may
think

thus
,
the
huge
amount
of
funds
pumped
into
research
and
development
on
nuclear
power
,
which
will
not
support
us
for
a   ArtOrDet
long-run   Mec
,
is
not
cost-effective

furthermore
,
with

forth   Rloc-
coming
price
drop
,
mac

expected
to
be
the
operating
system
of
choice
for
education

business
.

ageing   ArtOrDet
population
is
currently
a
global
phenomenon
that
occurs
in
many
parts
of
the
world
.

the
other
common
aspect
that
may
have
some
influence
in
the
safety
area
is
the
reaction
between
coolant
and
the
crust
of
the

which
may
directly
results
in
radioactivity   Wform
leaking   Wform
and
even

.

technology   ArtOrDet
created

has
significant
difference   Nn
in   Wci
comparison   Wci
with   Wci
-   ArtOrDet
technology
resulted
from
serendipitous
discovery
in
several
aspects
.

some
solutions
as   Rloc-
examples   Rloc-
would
be
to
design
plants/fertilizers
that
give
higher
yield
or
working
with
health
experts
introducing
new
ways
to
control
population
growth
.

gunpowder
did
n't
have
a
chance
to
step
onto
the

of
the   ArtOrDet
history
until
the
famous
adventurer
and
merchant
marco

introduce   Vt
it
to

.

when

the

because
it
give
a
different
definition
of   Prep

the   Wci

.

under   Wci
this
mode
of
education
for
-   ArtOrDet
long
time
,
people
's
thinking
is
limited
and
rigid
.

it
is
often   ArtOrDet
argued
that
the
implantation
of
rfid
is
a
violation
of
privacy
.

without   Wci
a
limitation
based
on
the
results
of
means
testing
,   Rloc-
it   Rloc-
would
lead
to
a
large
number
of
people
applying
for
grants
even
when
they
are
not
in
dire
need
for   Prep
such
concessions
.

therefore
-   Mec
to
make
the
aged
more
employable
,
there
is
a
need
to
move
away
from
-   ArtOrDet
seniority-wage
system
and
reduce
the
cpf
rates
.

in
addition
,
the
governement
has
also
increased
its
subsidies
for
day
care
,
nursing
home
-   ArtOrDet
,
and
hospital
to
give
the
elderly
a
better
quality
of
servies
.

on
top
of
its
technological
readiness
,
the   ArtOrDet
sfr
is
designed
for
high
efficiency
as
well
.

despite
the
fact
that
the   Wtone
approaches   Wtone
they   Wtone
take   Wtone
are   Wtone
obviously   Wtone
different
,
they
share
the

goal
,
which
is
to
innovate
the

products
.

third
,
it
is
the
bike   Rloc-
bug   Rloc-
level   Wform
of   Wform
acceptance   Wform
to   Mec
consumers
.

this
policy
will
give
the   ArtOrDet
older
people
a
chance
to
work
longer
and
contribute
to
the
society
.

current
nuclear
plants
(
known
as

iii
)
and
also
future   ArtOrDet
ones
emit
only
hot
steam
while
other
electricity
producers
like
coal
plants
pollute
the
environment
with
co2
and
so2
.

moreover
,
the
rate
of
birth
-   Vt
kept
falling
down   Rloc-
and
-   ArtOrDet
family
will
have
less   Wci
adult
children
than
they   Rloc-
had   Rloc-
in
the
past
,
which
puts
more
burdens
together   Rloc-
with   Rloc-
aging   Rloc-
population   Rloc-
to   Prep
the
government
to   Rloc-
deal   Rloc-
with   Rloc-
.

as
wilpert
(
2007   Nn
)
states
,
safety
of
engineering
design
depends
on
three
things
,
namely
,
effective
process
,
production
control
and
failure
avoidance
.

radioactive
emission   Nn
can
be   Wci
from
nuclear
explosion   Nn
or
nuclear
waste   Nn
.

moreover
,
this
service
system
allows
patients
to
get
consultation
from
doctor   Nn
using
the
device
whenever
they
fell   Vt
unwell
.

money
should
be
spent
on
education
,
research
and
growing
the
country
's
economy
so
that
people
can
have
larger
income
to
tap
upon   Wci
.

the
penicillium
notanum
can   Vm
prevent
the
growth
of
bacteria
.

most
of
the
elderly
do
not
have
proper
education
that
is
needed
in
today

from
the
above
examples
in
different
continents
,
it
is
inevitable
to
conclude
that
elderly
employment
is
one
of
the
policies
that
have   SVA
been
well
adopted
by
various
governments
.

finally

a
huge
success
as
its

were   Wci
world-famous
through

fortune

company   Nn
.

since
genetic
testing
is
beneficial
,
some
governments
have
come
up
with
legal
procedures
that
would
protect
suffers   Vform
from
genetic
discrimination
.

maybe
it
was
just
because
that   Rloc-
fleming
discovered
the   ArtOrDet
penicillin
by
chance
,
he
did
not
experience
any
failure
during
the
discovering
process
,
while
the
discovery
of
the
dna
's
structure
did
not
seem
to
be
that
easy
and
the
process
did
not
seem
to
be
smooth
,
either
.

apparently
,
the
cost

of

is
really
high

in

and
``

is
more
like
a

for
it

either
be
a

the

due
to
that
,
singapore
is
facing
a
serious

that
resulted
in

between   WOinc

it

it
is
still

of
the

generating
new
concepts
do   ArtOrDet
not
just
require
a
single

of
effort
,
as
what   Rloc-
people
believe
,
but
instead
require   SVA
a
longer
thought
process
which
may
take
days
or
even
months
.

opposition
argues
that
with
cctv
cameras
,
criminals
will   Srun
be
aware
that
they
are
being
watched
and
so
it
reduces
the
crime
rate
.

though
decades
of
self-reliance
had   Vt
taught
singaporeans
to
stand

and
learnt   Vt
-   Others
to
support
themselves
and
their

solely   Rloc-
,
now
they
can
no

do
so
.

the

that

disapproval   ArtOrDet

some

to

another
effect
is

and   Others
have
the
need
for
-   ArtOrDet
bike
bug   Nn
.

although
nuclear
wastes
will
be
produced
,
these
are
solid
wastes
that
can
be
stored
away
safely
with   Vform
current
technology
.

furthermore
,
according
to
''   Mec
a
technology   Mec
roadmap   Mec
``   Mec
(   Mec
2002
)
,   Mec
-   Mec
the
vhtr
can
generate
electricity
with
high
efficiency
,
over
50
%
at
1000°c
,
whereas
,
other
reactors
can
normally
have
an
efficiency
of
33
%
-50
%
.

the
present
paradigm
of
care
for
the   Vt
elderly
is
a
partnership
between
the
government
,
community
and
family
.

as
technology
is   Vt
getting   Vt
better
and
better
,
the
way
people
fight
with
each
other
is
also
improved   Wci
from   Wci
time   Wci
to   Wci
time   Wci
.

another   Rloc-
point   Rloc-
is   Rloc-
that   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
in   Mec
a
country
with
a
growing
aging
population
,
the
elderly
make
up
a
substantial
part
of
the
population
,   Srun
hence   Srun
play
a
bigger
role
in
decision-making
on
the   Rloc-
country   Rloc-
's   Rloc-
many
issues
.

in
conclusion
,
both
very
high
temperature
and
lead   Mec
cooled   Mec
fast
reactors
have
good
performance
and
excellent
safety
system   Nn
,
but
vhtrs
is   SVA
on
a
higher
end
as
compared
to
lfrs
due
to
the
greater
system
performance
and
system
safety
it
provides
.

however
,
it
is
not
ethical
to
pass
on
their
defective
genes
to   Wci
their   Wci
offspring
in
order
to
fulfill
the
dream
of
having
own
family
.

furthermore
,
this
report
also
stated
that
rfid
tags
could
promote
the
frequent
access
for
the
patient
to
their
medical
information
and
increase
the
continuity
and
coordination
of
care
which
resulting   Rloc-
reduction   Vform
many
kind   Nn
of
medical
error
like
adverse
drugs
event
.

and
when
they
have
-   ArtOrDet
ideas
-   Wci
how
to
solve
this
problem
,
they
need
to
ensure
-   Trans
they
select
the
idea
that
is
achievable
with
the
current
technology
by
``
analysing
the
solutions
''
.

in
view
of
the
accelerating   Wform
of
ageing   ArtOrDet
population
,
singapore   ArtOrDet
's   ArtOrDet
government
has
been
revamping
the
related
policies
constantly
to
mitigate
the
problem
.

hopefully
,
successful
technologies
-   Ssub
are
produced
by
both
means
.

nuclear
energy
uses
uranium   Mec
as   WOinc
a   WOinc
form   WOinc
of   WOinc
energy   WOinc
,   WOinc
which   WOinc
is   WOinc
a   WOinc
scarce   WOinc
resource   WOinc
.

this
will
reduce
the
greenhouse
emissions
as
smaller
amounts
of
fuel
would
be
needed
to
-   Mec
generate
the
same
amount
of
energy
,
thus
meeting
our
need
.

finally
the
tanker
sank
and
spilled   WOinc
the   WOinc
oil   WOinc
(

)
.

thirdly
,
there
should
be
an
increase
in
fund   Wform
on   Prep
the
healthcare
sector
.

despite
so   Pref
,
proponents
assured   Wci
that
with
proper
storage
and
appropriate
protection
measures
,
the
nuclear
waste
should
not
pose
any
health
risk
to
the
public
.

if   Trans
that
were
to
happen
,
it   Rloc-
would   Rloc-
impact   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
society   Rloc-
as   Rloc-
social   Um
cost   Um
would
increase
and
the
younger
generation
may
find
it
harder
to
start
a
family
.

however
,
in
terms
of
process
and
effort
,
the
research
to
develop   Rloc-
new
technology
is
different
from
the
serendipitous
discovery
.

hence
,
the
government
should
be
advised
to
continue
providing
for
the
aged
,   Srun
trying   Srun
to
overcome
the
obstacles
presented
and   Um
thus   Um
increase   Um
the   Um
provision   Um
whenever   Um
needed   Um
.

although
at
that
time
they
only
focused
on
solar
power
plant   Nn
.

currently
,
the
materials
applied
in
vhtr
are
more
advanced
and
steady
compared
to   ArtOrDet
the
past
.

whenever
a   Others
change   Others
the   Others
route   Others
during
flight
,
it
require   SVA
some
amount
of
time
before
the
pre-allocated
waypoint
can
be
reset
.

some
of
the
most
well-known
strategies
for
dealing
with
the
aging
population
are
extending
retirement   ArtOrDet
age
,
lengthening
working   Um
lives   Um
and
encouraging
financial
planning
during
economically
active
year
.

psychology
is
useful
in
foreseeing
latent
errors
and
thus
it
is
easier
to
come
out
with
-   ArtOrDet
solution
that
will
reduce
the
probability
of
-   Nn
accident
.

however
,
research
studies
(
butler
,
2004
)
shows   SVA
that
vhtr
do   SVA
not
undergo
waste
recycling
for   Trans
which   Trans
the
waste
being
produced
will
go
directly
to
-   ArtOrDet
repository
and   Rloc-
this   Rloc-
lead   Rloc-
to
the   Wci
possibility
of
obtaining
of   Prep
plutonium
ingredients
to
make
nuclear
weapons
to   Rloc-
be   Rloc-
low   Rloc-
and   Rloc-
in   Rloc-
turn   Rloc-
,
-   Trans
increased
the
security
of
the   Nn
nation   Nn
.

therefore
in
terms
of
researching   Um
,
i   Wtone
will   Wtone
be   Wtone
focusing   Wtone
on   Wtone
public
policies
aspect
of
the
ageing
population
.

people
living
in
well-developed
countries
have
high
standard   Nn
of
living
due
to
their
affluence
brought
about
by
the   Pform
stable
economy
.

however
,
the
operators
had
broken
many
important
rules
of
safety
just
to
complete
the
test
quickly
:
they
had
diminished
the
flow
of
coolant
water
,
disabled
the
automatic
shutdown
mechanisms
,   Trans
released
the
control
rods
from
the
machine
over
the
acceptable
limit
.

this
is
because
that   Trans
once
a
nuclear
reactor
accident
happened   Vt
,
it
would
be
a
huge
disaster
to
both
the
creatures
and
the
environment
within
that
area
.

this
is
-   V0
possible
through
communication
with
their
colleagues
,
which
can
help
them
to
stay
optimistic
.

after
that
,
the
atomic
bomb
came
up
,
which
leads   Vt
the   Wci
end
of
the
world
war
ii
.

whichever
way
an
invention
is
created
,
it
helps
satisfy
human
needs
and
solve
existing
problems
.

so
it
is
important
to
come
out   Wci
with
ideas
which
will
be
a   ArtOrDet
useful
and
economic   Wform
solution   Rloc-
to   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
problem   Rloc-
.

therefore
,
having
longer
life
span
does
help
to
ease
-   ArtOrDet
aging
process
.

however   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
the
vhtr
is   Vt
initially
designed
to
use
helium
as
its
coolant
which
is
not
the
most
suitable
for
an
instant
passive
heat
removal
system
.

from
-   ArtOrDet
analysis
,
the
vhtr
will
spend
fuel
in
a
symbiotic
fuel
cycle
that
can
achieve
significant
reductions
in
waste
quantity
and
radio
toxicity
because
of
its
ability
to
accommodate
a
wide
variety
-   Wci
mixture
of
fissile
and
fertile
materials
without
significantly
modification
of
the
core
design
(
u.s.
department
of
energy
nuclear
,
2002
)
.

however
,
due
to
the
plant
simplification
,
its
design
is
far   Um
simpler
,
that
is
,
without
the
circulation
pumps
,
pressurizers
,
steam
generators
and
dryers
.

considering
the
above
three
concerns
:   Mec
safety   Mec
,
cost   Mec
and
performance   Mec
,
the
generation
iv
international
forum
,
formed
by
ten
countries
,
puts
forward
six
outstanding
protocols
into
research
and
development
.

according
to
the
accident
investigation
report
(
ministry
of
manpower
,
2005
)
,
it
was
found
that
the
main
cause
of
the
collapse
was
due
to
underdesign   Wform
of
the
retaining
wall
which
could
not
handle
the
stress
of
holding
up
the
tunnel
.

one
popular
example
is
penicillin
,
where   Ssub
it   Ssub
turned
out
to
be
the
first
antibiotic
because
of
its
property
of
killing
biological
materials
when
it
was
left
in
petri
dishes
containing
biological
organisms
.

however
,
the
withdrawal
of
governmental
support   Rloc-
in   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
health   Rloc-
care   Rloc-
for   Rloc-
the   Rloc-
aged   Rloc-
would
shift
the
responsibility
to
the
families
of
these
aged
and
burden
the
development
of
the
country
in
the
long
run
.

therefore
,
this
has
increased
the
significance
of
-   ArtOrDet
cpf
as
it
compels
people
to
save
in
advance
lest
they
are
unable
or   Rloc-
have   Rloc-
no   Rloc-
one   Rloc-
to
support
them   Pref
during
their
old
age
.

therefore
-   Mec
most
of   Wform
china   Wform
enterprisers   Wform
focus
on
short-run
product   Nn
and
expect
instant
profit
.

subsequently
,
the
inventor
of
the
very   Rloc-
software
can
only
get
a
little
profit
,
which
will
not
impel
him
or
her
to
continue
paying
much
attention
to
the   ArtOrDet
innovation
.

a
country
that
is
not
expanding
as
fast
as
the
population
grows
will
bring   Um
forward   Um
insufficient
housing
for
its
people
.

in
consideration
of
these
factors
,
designers
have
conceived
the
3-d
printer
,
which
is
capable
of
speeding
up
designing
process   Nn
.

nevertheless
,
the
aging
process
is
commonly   Rloc-
viewed   Rloc-
as   Rloc-
an
unavoidable
,
undesirable
,
problem-ridden
phrase
of
life
that
we
are
required
to
go
through
it   Rloc-
.

people
are
afraid
of   Wci
gm
plants
may
break
the
balances   Nn
in
the   ArtOrDet
nature
.

because
of
the
staff
's
breach
of
duty
,
the
operators
detected
the
reactors
'
problem
very
late
and
-   ArtOrDet
even
took
erroneous
actions
.

besides
,
lots   Rloc-
public
spending
will
be
required
for
modifications
works
in
neighbourhood
estates
-   Srun
such
as
-   ArtOrDet
building
-   Prep
more
railings
and
slopes
with
anti-slipped
layer
(
tong
,
2007
)
.

importantly   Wform
as
it
is
,
very
few
old
people
managed   Vt
to   Vt
get
back
to
school
and
receive
education
again
.

besides
,
public
policies
that
encourage
and
facilitate
education
,
basic
research
,
and
the
application
of
promising
technologies
can
enhance
the
well-being
of
current
and
future
generations
of
older
people
(
robert
b.
friedland
and
laura
summer,2005
)
.in
other
words
,
elites
are
able
to
invent
more
advanced
technology
in   Wci
term   Wci
of   Wci
accelerate
nation   Wform
development
.

however
,
although
the   ArtOrDet
spending
on
the
aged
is
high
,
it
should
not
be
limited
.

meanwhile
,
helium
is
radioactive
when
it
is
radiated
,
unlike
the   ArtOrDet
other
coolants
.

therefore
,
the   ArtOrDet
current
development   Nn
,
research   Nn
and
policies
implemented   Vt
are   Vt
meant   Vt
to
ease
the
aging
process
-   Mec
and
they
are
highly
effective
.

today
,
one
of
the
main
concerns
about
human
need
is
the
innovation
of
a
more
environmental-friendly   Vt
vehicle
.

in
conclusion
,
surveillance
technology
should
be
banned
for   Wci
certain   Wci
degree   Wci
to
ensure
that
privacy
is
protected
and
the
security
issue
is
solved
also   Wci
.

for
elderlies   Vt
with
both
presbyopia
and
myopia
or
both
presbyopia
and
hyperopia
,
recent
improvements
in
lens
optics
has   SVA
created   Wci
bifocals
lens
(
convex
and
concave
lens
combined
into
a
single
lens
)
to   Srun
allow
the
elderly
to
have
both
their
presbyopia
and
myopia
or
both
their
presbyopia
and
hyperopia
to   Rloc-
be   Rloc-
corrected
.

therefore
,
the
adult
children
of
the
aged
seem
like
the
most
plausible
individuals
to
depend   Wci
on   Wci
by   Wci
providing   Wci
for
their
parents
.

several
problems
which
relate
to
the
issue
include
health   Others
,   Others
financial   Others
and   Others
welfare   Others
of
the
elderly
has   SVA
come
under
the
concern
of
the
government
.

in
this
example
,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
original
design
work
,
but
the
design
still
can
not
be
carried
out
due
to
political
inconsistent   Wform
between
the
city
government
and
higher
level
authorities
.

however
,
they
should
take
in   Prep
consideration
-   Wci
that
there
are
elderly
from
the
past
generations
without
good
education
who
have
not
been
able
to
save
in
their
younger
days
.

for
example
,
the
carbon-fibre
reinforced
carbon
can
bear
the
highest
temperature
which
the
vhtr
could
generate
.

there
are
cars
designed
for
easy   Rloc-
entry   Rloc-
for   Rloc-
the
wheelchair-bound
or
those
with
difficulty
walking
,
like
-   ArtOrDet
toyota
motor
corp.
's
welcab
series
.

conversely
,
if
the
country
is   Vt
not
knowledge   Mec
based
,
it
can   Vm
hardly
make
any
economic
progress
-   Srun
due
to
the
lack
of
understanding
of
technology
-   Wci
development
thus   Srun
leading   Rloc-
to
shortages
in
the
government
's
annual
budget
for
the
aged
.

moreover
,
lfr
has
a
comparative   Rloc-
safety
advantage
compared
to
the
other
nuclear
reactors
designs
.

such
policies
include
social
policy
like
increasing
the
retirement
age
,
allowing
more
work   Wci
age   Wci
immigrants
into
the
country
and
introducing
retirement
scheme   Wform
to
ease
basic
needs
after
retirement
.

adding
on
to
the
misery
,
the
cost
associated
with
healthcare
is
also
growing
with
the
combined
effect
of
-   ArtOrDet
rising
standard
of
living
and
-   Vt
high
cost
of
advanced
medical
development
.

the
elderly
can
be
stronger
and
less   Wci
of
them
will
be
suffering
from
physical   Wci
illnesses   Wci
,
such
as
stroke
,
diabetes
,
cancer
and
high
blood
pressure
.

in
addition
,
msr   Trans
uses   SVA
liquid
fuel
as
compared
to
the
other
reactors
that
use
solid
fuel
.

as   Prep
in   Mec
terms
of
all
the
policies
and
development   Nn
mentioned
above
,
especially
about   Prep
the
workfare
scheme
,
the
government
should
increase
the
net
payout
amount
(
cash
)
and
reduce
the
percentage
contributing
to
the
cpf
.

a
600   Wci
mwth
vhtr
dedicated
to
hydrogen
production
can
yield
over
2
million
normal
cubic
meters
per
day
.

besides
,
medisave
can
be
easily
drained
especially
on
chronic
illnesses
,   Wform
which
can
tote
up
to
a
huge
amount
.

some
governments
even
do
it
``
too
''
well
that
a
large
amount   Rloc-
of   Rloc-
money   Rloc-
,   Rloc-
which
should
be
spent
on
other
social
issues
,
is
wasted
.

the
consequences
of
-   ArtOrDet
population
aging
are
presenting
both
opportunities
and
challenges
for
all
nations
.

therefore
,
with   Vt
the   Vt
advancing   Vt
technologies   Vt
,   Vt
it   Wci
does   Wci
not   Wci
mean   Wci
that   Wci
every
product
that
was   Vt
invented
would
help
the
elderly
to   Rloc-
ease   Rloc-
into   Prep
the
aging
process
.

first   Wform
,
the   ArtOrDet
current
government
policies
are
not
easing
the
ageing
process
because
they
are
limited
to
a
specified
group
of
the
aged
population
.

nevertheless
,
singapore
is
planning
to
increase
their   Pform
spending
to
6.8
billion
euros
by
2010
and
target   SVA
to
spend
3
%
of
their
gdp
(
gafoor
,
2008
)
.

also
,
the
government
can
direct
more
technological
resources
to
school   Nn
so
as
to
better
equip
the
younger
generation
in   Trans
the   Trans
technological-edged
world
,
improving
their
economical
worth
.

tiles
or
pavements
with
better
friction
have
been
placed
in
toilets
to
prevent
-   ArtOrDet
elderly
from
slipping
.

applicants
for
insurance   ArtOrDet
will
be
under
increased
pressure
to
undergo
genetic
tests
and
those
prone
to
diseases
are
less
likely
to
be
eligible
to
buy
insurance
.

besides
,
the
aged
may
also
choose
to
carry
a
portable
digital
magnifier
which
takes
-   ArtOrDet
picture
behind
the
device
,
magnifies
it
to
-   ArtOrDet
desired
clearness
and
show   Wform
it
on
the
screen
such
as
pocketviewer
.

different
countries
also   Vt
promulgated
different
regulations
to
limit
the
use
of
the
camera
phone
.

furthermore
,
