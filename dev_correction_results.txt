the

expectancy   expectancies   Nn
of
individuals
has   have   SVA
increased
due
to
better
accessibility
to
healthcare
services
and
facilities
than   -   Rloc-
before   -   Rloc-
.

in
addition
,
a
better
health
care
system
will
allow
the
people
to
stay
healthier
and
prevent
some
major
illness   illnesses such as   WOinc
from   illnesses such as   WOinc
happening   illnesses such as   WOinc
like   illnesses such as   WOinc
stroke
and
heart
attack
.

one
cause
for
this
is
attributed   related   Rloc-
to
the
era   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
baby
boomers
,
who
are
now   mostly now   WOadv
mostly   mostly now   WOadv
in
their
late
fifties
or
early
sixties
.

before
this
solution
was
implemented
,
they
did
a
further
study
,
and
realized
that
the
solution
will   would   Vt
not
work
;   -   Mec
as
the
farmers
are   were   Vt
using
traditional
farming
methods
which
are
not
yield
efficient
.

due   to solve   Wci
to   to solve   Wci
these
problems
,
a
team
of
researchers
have
created
a
system
that
makes   -   Rloc-
use   ususes   SVA
of   -   Prep
sensors
to
identify
human
actions
and
uses   -   Rloc-
mobile
devices
to
remind
the
elderly
to
perform
daily
activities
.

if
the
fertility
rate
continues
to
drop
,
there
will
be   -   Rloc-
not
-   be   V0
enough
young
people
to
replace
the
older
generation
.

some
people
argue
that
welfare
of
the
aged
is
a
full
responsibility
of
the   in   Prep
government
as
they
have
contributed
to
the
society
for
many
years
and
it
is
a
way
of
showing
appreciation
to
them
.

with
the   this   SVA
mission
'better
jobs
for
life
'
,
this
institute
is
to
provide
help
to
the
workforce
.

as   Similar to   Wci
the
development
of
technology
,
the   -   Um
abilities   -   Um
of   -   Um
innovation
have   has become   Vt
becoming   has become   Vt
more
and
more
important
all
over
the
world
.

the
rewarding
of
the
elderly
does
not
push
the
country
forward
,
whereas
it
is
the
upbringing
of
our
youth
that
will
ensure
a   latter   Wci
future
for
our
country
.

hence
,
the
individual
should
bear
in
mind
the
impacts
that
may
arise
and
decide
if
they   he   Pref
should
reveal
such
results
.

thus
in
the
next
few
paragraphs
,
i
will
explain
in
depth
on   -   Prep
the
various
research
and
government
policies
being
developed
has   to   Wci
help
to   -   Rloc-
ease
the
aging
process
.

we
are
not   worried about not only   Wci
only   worried about not only   Wci
concerning   worried about not only   Wci
the
shortage
of
technology
but
also
considering   -   Rloc-
the
danger
of
terrorists
.

besides
that
,
the
burden
to
take
care
of
the
graying
generation
will
also
be
shared
by
the
children
of
the
elderly
people
-   ,   Srun
who
will   may   Vm
be
highly
educated
-   and therefore are able   Others
to
find
jobs
easily
to
support
their
families
.

therefore
,
they
may
get
even
more
money
for   on   Prep
their
own
-   rather   Trans
than
receiving
-   money   Spar
from
the   -   ArtOrDet
government

.

the
parties
involved
take   took   Vt
pride
in
their
work
.

the
safety
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
scwr
has
been
proven
and
can
be
better   bettered   Wform
in
the
future
.

thus
,
compulsory
saving
can
help
guarantee
a
sizable
amount
of
saving
for
their
future
and
is
a
practical
and
effective
way
to
ensure
old
age
dependency
is
-   being   Vt
kept
to
the
minimum
.

in
another
word
,
if
one
was
tagged
,
he
risked
being
permanently
marked
for   humans   Nn
life   humans   Nn
due
to
the
difficulty
of

.

yes
,
they
are
right
,
but
they
are
just
comparing
swcr
with
the   -   ArtOrDet
generation
iii

,
not

.

for

,
if

belongs
to
an
individual

we   people   Wtone
should
pay
a

this   This   Srun

in

have
been
made
to

it
is
the
fact
that

travels
through

as

therefore
,
we
can
say
that
limitation
on
spending
for
the
aged
is
a
good
idea
since
in
indonesia
,
there
is   are   SVA
still
many
areas
that
are
not
well
developed
yet
-   ,   Mec
especially
in

economic
area

some
of
them   these   Pref
are   include   Wci
encouraging
later
retirement
,
raising   -   Um

children   -   Um
,
encouraging
the
elderly
and
their

to
take
more
responsibility
for

,
etc
.

it
reduces
the
probability
of
making
mistakes
and
level
of
seriousness
of
accidents
.

on   However   Trans
the   However   Trans
contrary   However   Trans
,
people
often
question
the
effectiveness
of
these
initiatives
.

experiments
and
tests
are
not
to
be
omitted
in
laboratories
.   they are not completed without confirmations from lab work and data..   WOinc

besides
this
,
remote
controlled
lighting
helps
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
to
control
the
house
lights
with
a
remote
control
,   and   Srun
therefore
,
it   -   Rloc-
minimizes
the
risk
-   of   Wci
falling
in
the
dark
.

instead
of
treating
the
elderly
in
society
as
an   a burden   Wci
expense   a burden   Wci
,
the
government
can   should   Vm
think
of
ways
to
harness

knowledge
and
experience
from   -   Rloc-
them   -   Rloc-
so
that
they
can
contribute
back

therefore
,
the

have
to
rely
on
the

aging
impacts
a

in
many
ways

with
both
psychological

changes

including
chronic
diseases
associated
with

.

besides   In addition   Trans
,
the
molten

can
solve

problems
perfectly   completely   Wci

whilst
some
insisted
that
the

because
it

so
it
has
been

cut
public

on

also
,
it

however
,
i
have
to
say
that
these
people
are
so
short-sighted   have   SVA
that
they
did
not
find
the
fundamental

apart

that

these

they

the
specific
consumer
domains
when
they
first   -   Rloc-
accidently   accidentally   Wform
discover

the
second
consequence
is
about
the
genetic

especially
in

(

the

it

nevertheless
,
some
may

it
is   -   Rloc-

the
government
have   has   SVA
also
been
legislating   enacting   Wci
laws
that
require
employers
to
offer
re-employment
to
their
workers
until
the
age
of

is
a
flexible
approach
because
the

do
not
have
to
get

.

once
knowing   the reasons are known   WOinc
the   the reasons are known   WOinc

researchers
can
come

without

after
all

not

the

people
will
also
benefit
from
the

one
of
the
policies

one

this

this

these

as

the

throughout

other
than

,
china

however
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
public
is
very
concern   concerned   Wform
about
the
safe
operation
of
nuclear
reactors
.

in
order
to
make

meet
the   -   ArtOrDet
needs
,
first
of
all
,
-   a   ArtOrDet
clear
and
unambiguous
definition
of
this   the   ArtOrDet
problem
should
be
defined
.

their
focus
,
instead
,
is
directed
at

routine

and
their
own

matters
and
therefore
,
the
element
of
creative   creativity   Wform
is
not

of

robbers
can
identify

person   persons   Nn
just
by

therefore
the
solution
was
specified
and
the

process
was
nearing
completion
.

this
could   -   Rloc-
be
a
serious
security
flaw
;
in
case
the
plutonium
is
stolen
it
could
be

in

these

are
still
in

it
is
well-known
that
the

is
facing
a
growing
aging

and
this
trend
is
unlikely
to
be
reserved
in

therefore

they

during
a
design
process
,
designers
do
not
focus
on
human
response
to
the

and
there
is
frequent
mismatch
between
the   -   ArtOrDet
operators
and
the   -   ArtOrDet
designed

(
wilpert

.

in
the
event
of

,
these

will
dissipate
into

therefore

the   -   ArtOrDet

in

even
if

some
may
argue
that

should

one
current   challenge   Wci
human
need
that
should
be
given
priority
for

is
to
have
cost
saving
electronics

the

the   -   ArtOrDet

on
the
other
hand
,
the

calls
for

larger

however
,
more
emphasis
should

the

to   -   Wci
which   -   Wci
limitations   -   Wci
of
public
spending
on
the

has
always
been
a
complicated
issue

this
has
resulted
in
very
different
products
-   being   V0
developed
by   in   Prep
each
environment

despite
the
above
said   -   Rloc-
,
it
may
be
objected   argued   Wci
that
as
the
elderly
had   -   Vt
contributed
significantly
to
the
country
's
development
in
their
younger
days
,
in
view
of
their
long

,
they

more

than
the
rest
of

therefore
,
emotional

are
unpredicted   unpredictable   Wform
and
it
depends
on
the
believed   belief   Wform
and
mindset
of

even
for
the

kind
of
material
,
it
might
have

as
the

fabricated
is
not

resulting
in
a
wastage
and
hence
greater
consumption
of
raw
materials
and
therefore
a
greater
cost
incurred
in
the
designing
process
.

secondly
,
there
are
laws
such
as

genetic

the   In addition , the   Trans

are
not

fill
the
gap
left
by
the

who
leave

an
example
is
that
there
has
been
quite
a
number   lot of   Wci
research
on
the
kind
of

which   -   Rloc-

will

the

at
the

time
,
more
and
more
facilities
are
designed
to
meet
the
needs
of

in

some

a

hence
,
the
idea
of
spying
people
by
using

such   -   Wform
as

has
to
be
banned
.

one
such
example
is
the

for

such
as
the

costs

adopt

while
it
is
important
to

,
it
-   ,   Srun
is
just
as
important
to
take
into
consideration
and
not
neglect
other
areas
of
the
country

development
.

that
is
,
both
are
largely
successful
.

all
the
alternative

mentioned
are
green
compared
to
the
burning
of
fossil

in
terms
of
emission
to
-   the   ArtOrDet
environment
.

the
two
main
causes
for
this
problem
are
population
outburst
and
corruption
.

in
north
korea
's
case
,
they
started
the
development
of
nuclear

because
of
the

basically
,

this
brings

of

as
much
as

in

hence
,
local

encounter
their

test
in
their

there

the
success
of
a
technology
not
only
depends
on
how
well
it
resolves
the
targeted
need
but
also
the
social
considerations
it
incurs
when
-   being   V0
introduced
to
the
consumer

for
example
,
when
the   -   ArtOrDet
families
have
an
average

instead
of
two
or

the

hence

in

secondly

therefore
,
for

as

,
once

and

because

as

in

development

thus

grooming
then
,
comes
in
the
form
of
a
more
sophisticated
infrastructure
for
learning
and
monetary
incentives
or
aids
in
-   the form of   WOinc
scholarships
and

there
are
some
products

directly
copy

of

the
similarities

them
come

it
is
,   -   Rloc-
however   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
maybe   -   Rloc-
approached   -   Rloc-
from   -   Rloc-
another   -   Rloc-
angle   -   Rloc-
that   -   Rloc-
a
constant
proportion
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
gdp
of
a
country
to
support
the
old
people
is
maintained
.

the
culture
in   given   Wci
singapore
does
not
even
allow
our
workers
to
make
time
for
this
crucial
concept
generation
process
.

social
policies
,
practices
and
attitudes
discourage
working
at
an
older
age
because
the
retirement
for
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
will
be
costly
for
firms
.

however
,
the
policy
of
engineering
and
industry
can
not
meet
the   these   ArtOrDet
needs
.

these
examples
show
that
even
the   -   ArtOrDet
machine
errors
can
be
eliminated
by
carefully
design   designing   Wform
and
applying
psychology
in
the
design
process
to
predict
all
the
cases   scenarios   Wci
that
may
happen
in
the
future
.

thus
,
public   increasing   Wform
spending   increasing   Wform
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
and
the
money
should
be
diverted
to
other
areas
of
the
country
's
development
.

the
engineers
keep
working
and
working

have   to generate a lot of profit   Wci

the
poor
quality
of
products
hamper
the
interests
of
customers
and
yet   -   Rloc-
affect
the
fame   reputation   Wci
of
the
famous

.

another
major   serendipitous   Wform
difference
is
the
length
of
time
used
on
the
research
.

with
the
growing
population
and
various
problems
that
the
present
governments   government   Nn
face
today
,
the
governments
are
finding
it
tedious
to
balance
the
budget
to
ensure
that
all
areas
of
development
are
being
met
.

all
in
all
,
it
is
the
low
level
of
technological
base
and
the
lack
of
excellent
researchers
that
significantly
hamper
the
whole
process
for
innovation
.

nevertheless
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
ageing
population
is
likely
to
hurt
public
finances
,
it
is
crucial
to
recognize
the
well-being
and
livelihood
of
the
aged
can
not
be

by
investing
in

it   They   Pref
can
bring

as   Therefore   Trans
such   Therefore   Trans
,
i
agree
that
public
spending
on
the
aged
should
be
limited
so
that
funds
can
be
diverted
to
other
areas
like
-   the   ArtOrDet
ministry
of
finance
,
education
,
health
and
national
development
.

besides
the
infrastructure
construction
,
another
advisable
method
to
increase
production
is
to
mechanize
the
agriculture   agricultural   Wform
system
.

although
it
has
resulted
in
a
sounding   resounding   Wform
success
,
the
technology
has
not
been
widely
implemented
due
to
patents
of
the
technology
being
filed
by
the
parent
companies
.

henceforth   Hence   Trans
,
to
meet
the
world
's
energy
needs
,
scientists
are
re-addressing
the
potential
benefits
from   of   Prep
harnessing

thus

human   humans   Nn

also
,
the

among

,
the

it

then

:   arises ,   Wci
what

?

when
there
was
a

they
tried
to
put

,
hoped   hoping   Vt
that
-   the   ArtOrDet
power
level
could
be
lowered
.

the
social
policies   -   ArtOrDet
adopted
have
greatly
introduced
the
older
population
into
the
workforce
and
the
volunteering
sector
,
thus
keeping
them
actively
involved
in
the
community
and
easing
the
aging
process
to
a
large
extent
.

on
the
contrary
,
some
people
might
think
that
using   dollars   Nn
shielding

is
already
an
effective
protection
mechanism
against
data
theft
and
data
corruption
(

.

this
is
because
there
is
still
a
need
to
contribute
to
the

in   -   Rloc-

besides
that

it
is
also
important
for

in

according
to
khandani
(

)
'engineering   has   SVA
design

'
is
a
sequence
of

to

firstly
,
the
main
problem
of
aging
population
-   the   ArtOrDet
is
that
the
children
do
not
want
to
take
care
of
their
parents
when
they
are
old
,
because
they
think
that
parents
are
troubles
for
them
,
since
they
are
old
and
unable
to
contribute
.

according
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
friedland
and
summer
(
2005
)
,
if
a
nation
spend   spends   SVA
more
on
the
aged
,
besides
slowing
down
the
growth
of
the
nation
,
it
will
also
create
more
costly
problems
in
future
.

another
challenge
that
the   -   ArtOrDet
innovators
need
to
be
concern   concerned   Wform
about
is
commercializing
the
finalize   finalized   Wform

.

such
an
approach
enables
engineers
to
think
out
of
the
bounder   box   Wci
and
challenge
the
old
conventions
,
and
subsequently
forges   forge   SVA
innovative
breakthroughs
in
fields
,   -   Mec
like   such as ,   Trans

that

although
there
is
no   -   ArtOrDet
nuclear
incidence   incidences   Nn
happen   have not happened   Vt
in
recent
years
,
it
is
too
biased
to
say
that
the
engineering
psychology
can
solved   solve   Vt
the
problems
by
itself
.

the
government
should
divert
the
money
into
education
to
equip
the
people
with
the
right
attitude
and
working
skills
,
so
as
to
ensure
a   -   ArtOrDet
stable
economy   economic   Wform
growth
for
the
country
.

for
instance
,
it
is
more
safe
now
for
patients
who
have
mental   -   Rloc-
lost   -   Rloc-
or   -   Rloc-
mental
diseases
if
they
are
lost
,
because
they
are
being
tracked
all
the
time
in
the
hospital
under
the
surveillance
system
like
rfid
.

there
have
been
many
proposed

that
acts   act   SVA
to

such   This   Wci
is
preferred
than   to   Wci
making
corrections
only
after
-   an   ArtOrDet
accident
-   has   V0
occurred
.

however
,
the
benefits
of

surveillance
should
not
be
downplayed
.

naturally
,
for
those
who
ca
n't

it

,
we
should
extend

singapore

building
an

therefore

they

hire
a

who
is
more
competent

and
most

younger

if

,
there
will
be
a
tremendous
strain

will

this

three

factors

stages

the
second
step
in

is
the

if

most
priority

he
would

one
such
method

such

one

one
of
the
many
reasons
given
to
support
the

is
that
-   the   ArtOrDet
scwr
is
the   a   ArtOrDet
combination
of

which
are
light

.

since
there
are
foundations
for

one
step
that

taken
is
to
unite

this

the

in

they
realize
the

problem

up   -   Vt
now   -   Vt
is

finally
is
the

with

they

less

the

it

however
,
science

(

notes
that

in
conclusion
,
sfr
stands
as
a
more
viable
option
to

so
for

there
should

results

another
example   -   Rloc-
about   -   Rloc-
public
spending
on
medical

for
the

is
the
elderly
,
who
represented
about
7
per

accounted

they

social

where

we

the
current
generation
of
elderly
is
most
probably
the
first
batch
to
learn
about
the

in
1955
,
and
being
a
young

then
,
there
is
a
high
chance
that
they
-   were   V0
unable
to
fully
benefit
from
it
.

on
the
other
hand
,
it
is
fortunate
that
the
singapore
central

(
cpf
)
,
which
is
the
fundamental
pillar
of

the

the   -   ArtOrDet

be

that

like

but   -   Wtone
,   -   Wtone
the   -   Wtone

problem   -   Wtone
may   -   Wtone
be   -   Wtone
exaggerated

due
to
a
variety

reasons

it
is
now

ranging
from
testing
the
congenital

there

therefore

innovations

were

are
usually   -   ArtOrDet
created
faster
than
those

created
by

for

critics

in

innovation

this
is

although

the

came
up
with
the   the   Mec
maintenance
of

act
in
the   -   ArtOrDet
1996
and
has
been
studying
to

would
reduce
the

,   and subsequently   Ssub
therefore   and subsequently   Ssub
,
the
government
's
budget
on
the
elderly
need
not
be
as
huge
.

hence
,
there
is
a
worry
that
the
government
will
neglect
the
subsidies
to
other
important
sectors
,
such
as
education
and
defence.however
,
people
should
not
worry
about
this
because   care   SVA
increasing
subsidies
for
elderly
can
increase
the
new
opportunity
for
the
young

thus
,
the
responsibility
of
the
younger

can
be
greatly
reduced
from   , such as   Srun
decrease   the   ArtOrDet
need
of

this
is
because

the

i
will
further
elaborate
on
my
stand
based   -   ArtOrDet
on
the
above
two
aspects
.

for
instance   mentions   Vt
,
the
government
should
spend
part
of
the

budget
in
trying
to
increase
the
fertility
rate
.

they
need
to
recognize
that
the
effectiveness
of
any
strategies
will
depend
on
every
individual
involvement
.

moreover
,
the
ever
increasing
risk
of
terrorism
will
result
in
a
much
threatening
situation
if
-   the   ArtOrDet
nuclear
weapon
is
been   -   Rloc-
stolen
.

one
example   less   Wci
would
be
designing
a
fridge
that
uses
less
power
to
run
.

obviously
,
to
lessen
the
world
's
thirst
of   for   Prep
energy
in
the
long
term
,
and
to
reduce
the
growing
number
of
disasters
,
i
am
in
favor
of
using
nuclear
power
as
a
main
resource
of
energy
in
the
future
.

likewise
,
in
singapore
,
the
government
spends
s
$
110
million
to   on paying   Wform
pay   on paying   Wform
basic
medishield
premiums
for
two
years
for

so
that
90
%
of
the
elder   elderly   Wform
can
have
health
care
benefits
(
cited
in

)
.

one
of   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
examples   example   Nn
of
-   a   ArtOrDet
medical
system
is
``
posture

which
can
monitor

compared

thus
they
are   find   Vform
the
reasons

however
,
according
to
the
american
association
for
mental
retardation
aamr
[

]
,
revealing
of
genetic
testing
results
is
not
a
form
of
discrimination
but
it
is
to
be
fair
to
those
children
with
these
genetic
diseases
as
the
child   children   Nn
will
be
enrolled
into
the
school
that
provide   provides   SVA
a
better
environment
for
them
to
study
in
.

for
example
,
lee
kuan
yew
,
minister
mentor
of
singapore
,
is
still
active
in
the   politics   Nn
politic   politics   Nn
by
advising
the   -   ArtOrDet
young
politicians
.

therefore
,
as
much
as
other
-   a   ArtOrDet
problems
,
mainly
those
dealing
with
the
economy
,
may
seem
to
demand
and
need
more
immediate
attention
,
the
ageing
population
issue
can
not
be
ignored
and
the
spending
on
this
area
should
not
be
reduced
in
order
for
majority
of
the
population
to
benefit
.

for
example
,
japan
's
atomic
energy
research
institute
based
in
kashiwa
has
already
operated
a
similar
reactor
as
the
vhtr
which
is
able
to
reach
a
record
high
temperature
of
950
degree
celsius
in
2004
.   -   Rloc-

being
covered
by
healthcare
insurance
has
become
critical
for
old
people
-   ,   Srun
especially
those
with
disabilities
and
chronic
illness
associated
with
aging
.

instead
,
the
government
should
allow
its
public
spending
on
the
aged
to
hang   hover   Wtone
around   hover   Wtone
a   at   Wci
certain
percentage
.

the
findings
were
used
for
prevention   the prevention of   SVA
to   the prevention of   SVA
these
illness   illnesses   Vt
,
thus
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
who
are
more
prone
to
these
diseases
are
able
to
take
more
precaution
to   with   Trans
their
health
.

by
maintaining
a
socially
active
lifestyle
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
are
more
resistance
to
health
problems
as
they
are
able
to
keep
both
their
mind
and
body
active
and
healthy
.

in
addition
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
efficiency
is
raised
effectively
due
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
high
temperature
,
which
accordingly
reduces
the
use
of
fuel
and
the
cost
of
complementary
equipment
by
50
%
or
more
.

the
reason
for
the
collapse
of
nicoll
highway
was
not
solely
due
to
-   a   ArtOrDet
mistake
in
the
design
.

this
is
different
from
scwr
-   ,   Mec
which
uses
water
as
the
coolant
and
hence
there
is
a
possibility
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
pipe
's
corrosion
by
water
.

using
rfid
to
track
people
arises
many
issues   tracking   Mec
.

for
instance
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
central
provident
fund
(
cpf
)
,
a
comprehensive
financial
savings
plan
for
the
workers
-   ,   Mec
has
been
implemented
in
singapore

including

,

and
manpower

with
this

.

in
the
1950s
,
the
soviet
union
tested
their
first
atomic
bomb
resulting
in
the
world
having
two
nuclear
super
powers
that
were
conflicting   at conflict   Wci
with
each
other
over
world
political
dominance
and
military
superiority
.

investing
in
the   -   ArtOrDet
economic
growth
will
reduce
the
stress
of   on   Prep
the
younger
generation
as
more
jobs
will
be

will
be
available

the   -   Rloc-

.

first
of
all
,
if
psychology
approaches
were   commonly   Wci
introduced
in
the
design
process
,
product
safety
could
be
better
guaranteed
.

therefore
if
the
engineers
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
titanic
were
prudent
in
the
engineering
design
process
,
they
would
have
included
a
high
margin
of
safety
factor
to
anticipate
possible
failure
during
the   its   Pref
construction
of   -   Rloc-
titanic   -   Rloc-
.

hence
,
the
government
is   will then be   Vt
then   will then be   Vt
able
to
divert
spending
to   towards   Vt
the   -   ArtOrDet
national
growth
.

they
perceived
public
spending
on
the
aged
as
a
form
of
liability
to
a
country
because
such
spending
brings
no
future
benefits
to
the
country
,
and
-   may   V0
cause
the
country
to
neglect
its
development
in
essential
areas
,
such
as
infrastructure
and
transport
facilities
,
which
serve
as
a
pulling
force
for
foreign
direct   -   Rloc-
investments
.

preparing
for
-   the   ArtOrDet
an
aging
population
:
the
singapore
experience
.

there
are
also   of   Prep
worries
over
leaked
confident
information
through
rfid
tags
.

although   -   Rloc-
such   -   Rloc-
may   -   Rloc-
argue   -   Rloc-
this   -   Rloc-
way   -   Rloc-

it
is
better
to

the
devastating
sickness   disease   Wci
-   to   Wci
continue
to
haunt
out   -   Rloc-
-   the   ArtOrDet
older

.

therefore
,
nuclear
power
actually
costs
about
the   ve to   Prep
same
as
coal
.

security
guards
and
camera   cameras   Nn
can
also
be

of

in
my

,
the

because   due to the following   WOinc
the   due to the following   WOinc

reason   due to the following   WOinc
:
firstly
,
the

are
citizens
who

contributed
a

of
money
to

national

however

they

by   through   Prep
proper

in
all
,
moving
beyond
-   the   ArtOrDet
law
to
enhance
the
perceptions
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
is
a
more
practical
way
to
increase
the
ability
and
willingness
of
the
society
to
coordinate
with
the

in
tackling
the
``

''
.

to
add

the
problems

the

currently
needs

better

in
terms
of
safety

as
its   -   Rloc-

in

,
it
could
be
concluded
that
spending
money

on
economy
would
make
people
wealthy
,
which
could
greatly
help
to
ease
the

on

hand
,
the
wastes
produced
by
the   -   ArtOrDet
nuclear

are
highly
radioactive
and
can
not
be
easily
disposed

however
once
the

becomes   become   SVA
over
dependent
on

they
will
be

in

the

firstly
,

in

in

even
though
there
may

and

along

but   -   Rloc-
by
bearing
in

three

:   , namely ,   Mec
the

the

and
most

,
the
importance
of
having
a

,
we
are
able
to
push
the
development
of
nuclear

to
greater
heights
.

this
group
should
be
categorized   -   Prep
as
the
vulnerable
group
.

the
payoff
of
this
investment
is
a
highly
efficient
and
the   -   ArtOrDet
productive
workforce
.

however
,
not
every
elderly
in

can
get   spent   Vform
to
enjoy
these
perks
,
especially
those
who
are
bounded
by
financial

this
includes
desalination
and
damping
up

companies
do
save
up   -   Rloc-

as
these

more

and

will
cut

costs
.

last
but
not
least
,
-   the   ArtOrDet
the
price
of
an
ergonomical

should
be
reasonable
.

the

though

in

the

among
all
those   these   Pform
socially
determined
resistance
on   to   Prep
the
way
of

,
one
fatally
significant
phenomenon
is
the
unfair
competition
between
monopolies

other
less

firstly
,
many

lack

however

there
is

together
with
the
increase
of
unemployment

in

,
it
presents
a
worrying
trend
of
its
citizen
entering
the
retirement
age
of
their

.

afonso
's
view
supports
my
stand
that
public

should   being   Vform
be   being   Vform
diverting

fundamental

-   The   ArtOrDet

because
without

a
proper

at
all
stages

the   repeat   Vform
process
,
you
may
find
yourself
into
trouble
later

the
next
question
-   that   Trans
needs
to
be
debated
is
:
``
how
much
money

the   -   ArtOrDet
government

the   the elderly ? `` .   Npos

however
,
it

in

secondly

in

some

social

in

first

,
all

this
is

when

the   -   ArtOrDet

``

the

and
the

another
is
that

however
,
an

by

before

another
problem
we

however

this

if

a

concern

from

very
long

but
medical

seems
not

be

in

fight
with
countless
threats
that
steals
many
human

are
many
limitations
that
only   can only   Wform
can   can only   Wform
be
surpassed
by
the
magic
of

technology
.

finally
,
we
could
say
that
the
process
of
the   -   ArtOrDet
aircraft
innovation
was
quite
devious   tortuous   Wci
.

in

,
nuclear

for
example
,
the
rising

of

for
the

has
taken
its
toll
on

and
many
could   can   Vt
not
afford
that   it   Pref
.

however
,
the
use
of
nuclear

on

country
has
been
non-existent
since
wwii
as
countries
realize
the
chaos
it
could
cause

singapore

well-known
as   to be   Wci

no

can
guarantee
that

live

will
eventually
take

this

would
turn   have turned   Vt
out
differently
if

in   . In   Srun
other
words

educated

on

,
the

would
have
been
evacuated

even

in
this
essay
,
how
does   -   Rloc-
engineering
design
processes
-   can   Vm
cope
with
the
energy
crisis
will
be
discussed
in
terms
of
gathering
pertinent
information
and
analysis
and
selection   selecting   Vform
of   selecting   Vform
an
optimized
solution
.

government
needs
to
focus
the
spending
on
more
important
sectors
first
like
economic
development
before
worrying
about
healthcare
for
the
elderly
.

anyhow
,
as
a
member
in   of   Trans
the
family
,
it   one   Pref
is
obligated
to
tell
the
genetic
test
results
to
-   one '   Pref
own
relatives
.

furthermore
,
when
considering
the
design
of
the
product
,
there
is
a
need
to
make
special
considerations
that
are
suitable
for
the   -   ArtOrDet
elderly
use
.

everyone
should
-   be   V0
responsible
and
play
-   an   ArtOrDet
important
role
in
the
family
.

as
mentioned
earlier
,
one
reason
why
we
should
not
limit
the
spending
is
that
it
may
not
be
fair
to
the
elderly
when
the   -   Rloc-
public   -   Rloc-
spending   -   Rloc-
is   -   Rloc-
limited   -   Rloc-
as   -   Rloc-
among   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
elderly   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
there
may
be
people   those   Pref
who
are
really
in
great
need
of
the   -   ArtOrDet
support
from
the
government
.

second
,
the
lta
's
personnel
,
due
to
slothfulness
,
did
not
do
his/her   their   Pform
job
on
ensuring
the
safety
of
building
works
by
performing
checks
on
-   the   ArtOrDet
construction
work
.

the
upgrading
process
might
cause
inconveniences
to
the
residents
but
-   this   Pref
is
a
pay   trade   Wci
off
that
they
have
to
bear
with
for
a
better
tomorrow
.

the
debiting
and
crediting
process
is
automated
,
thus
the
citizen
need
not
do
anything
but
he
will
still
be
notified
regularly
with
his
cpf
account
statement
.

swcr
does
not
recycle
the   -   ArtOrDet
waste
which
is
not
that
safe
.

there
are
various
non-profitable
organizations
all
over
the
world
seeking
cure   cures   Nn
for
common
illness
among
elderly
an
example
will
be
for
parkinson
disease
there
is
the
parkinson
's
institute
and
clinical
center
in
america
.

hence
,
we   public spending on the aged should not be limited..   Wtone
still   public spending on the aged should not be limited..   Wtone
should   public spending on the aged should not be limited..   Wtone
not   public spending on the aged should not be limited..   Wtone

one
reason
for
revealing
the
result
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
family
members
is
that
the
result
is
not
only
applicable
to
the
individual
but
also
to
other   his   Pref
family
members
,
as
they
may
also
have
inherited
the

for
my

china
,
although
its

as

it
is
necessary
to
have
an
international
organization
to
supervise
the
process
of
every
country

it

from

last
but
not
the

,
is
the
security
.

consequently
,
generation

nuclear

are   were   Vt
born
,
including   which includes   Others
six
models
.

in
the
case
of
iraq
,
satisfying
the
basic
needs
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
people
is
the
most
important
thing
which
should
be
put
first
.

as
the
aging
problems
are
getting
seriously   serious   Wform
nowadays
,
it
should
not
be
invariably   -   Rloc-
neglected
by
the
society
but
to
face
the
problem
that
the
elderly
may
suffer
financial
hardships
in
their
golden
age
after
they
-   have   Vt
retired
.

in   From   Prep
my
perspective
,
it
may
not
be
practical
-   ,   Srun
especially
for
the   -   ArtOrDet
developing
countries
with
large
population
.

for
examples   example   Trans
,
there
are
also
many
-   other   Others
needy
people
like
orphans
,
the
disabled
or
unemployed
that
want
to
be
subsidized
by
the
government
.

secondly
,
any   supporters   Wci
supports   supporters   Wci
of
traditional
power
plants
argue
that
the
cost
of
building
nuclear
plants
is
much
higher
than
for   that of building   Spar
the   -   ArtOrDet
coal
plants
.

on   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
other   -   Rloc-
hand   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
due   Due   Mec
to
the   a   ArtOrDet
fast-paced
and
stressful
working
environment
nowadays   -   Rloc-
,
the
elder
generations
would
not
be
motivated
to
extend
their
stay
in
the
workforce
.

hence
,
we
can
conclude
that
automation
can
be
seen
as
a
tool
in
relieving
the
aging
process
that   -   Rloc-
can   -   Rloc-
be   -   Rloc-
beneficial   -   Rloc-

secondly
,
biological
change
is
another
-   the   ArtOrDet
change
that
aging
brings
about
.

however
,
the
rising
standard
of
living
can
cause
some
factors
that
will
contribute
to
the
aging
population
such
as
high-quality
health
care
,
which
helps
people
live
longer
.

instead
,
it
is   should be   Vm
a
must
for
him
to
disclose
his
disease
to
:   -   Mec
his
spouse
to
save
their
baby
from
inheriting
the
disease
,
-   to   Spar
his
employer
to
make
sure
that
his
job
is
safe   for him   Others
and
-   to   Spar
all
people
around
him
-   to fulfil his sense of responsibility   Spar
.

due
to
the
above
two
problems
,
chinese
engineering   engineering   Mec
design
was
harmed
seriously
.

there
is
a
need
for
this
development
as
currently
nuclear
reactors
are
not
that
safe
and
efficient   -   Spar
.

furthermore
,
besides
ensuring
that
the
elderly
will
have
sufficient
funds
for
their
living
expenses
after
their
retirement
,
the
singapore
government
has   also ensures   Vt
also   also ensures   Vt
ensured   also ensures   Vt
that

through
the
implementation
of
policies
such
as
the

(
healthcare

,

)
.

therefore
the
current
problem
singapore

facing
now
is
the

population
.

it

however
,
this
is
not
always
true
because

can
overcome
some
obstacles
that
they
faced   face   Vt
during
the
aging
process
.

for
a
country
-   ,   Srun
spending
in   on   WOinc
education
is
consider   seen   Wci
as
injecting

into
an

whereas
spending
on
the

is
consider   considered   Vt
as
-   introducing   V0
a

no

therefore

an

only
if

,
are

concerned
and
given
due

can
the
world

therefore
,
if
they
are
in   increase   Vt
need

why
not
just
help
them
?

its
success
is
determined
mainly
by
three
factors

thus

the   -   ArtOrDet

as

this
will
mean
that
there

indeed

the

opponents   The opponents   ArtOrDet
of
surveillance
technology
argue
that
surveillance
technology
invades
privacy
.

since
it
is
much
more
expensive
than
-   the   ArtOrDet
usually
used
firepower
plant
,
whether
nuclear
power
plant   plants   ArtOrDet
can
provide

efficiently
with
a
reasonable

became
a
rather
essential
problem
.

dependence   overdependence   Mec
on
the
government
by   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
children   -   Rloc-
,
public

should
be
limited
and
be
diverted
to
other
areas
for
better
use
.

at
the
same
time
,
the
technology
to
dig
on
the
moon
,
and
even
use
helium
as
a
fuel
is
still
not
available
yet
.

though
some
may
agree
that
public
spending
on
the
aged
largely
aids
the   -   ArtOrDet
society
in
coping
with
the
needs
of
an
ageing
population
,
however   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
it
may
-   also   Trans
hinders
the
development
in
other
sectors
.

before
a
technology
innovation
is
developed
and
patented
,
scientists
have
to
go
through
a
tedious
research
process
most   are   Vt
of
the
time
.

the
government
has
highlighted
to
the
public
the
importance
and
benefits
of
financial
planning
for
their   -   Rloc-
old
age
.

though
the
use
of
rfid
technology
has
its
merits
such
as
crime
prevention
,
it
should
still   -   Cit
be   -   Cit
barred   -   Cit
because   -   Cit
the   -   Cit
use   -   Cit
of   -   Cit
surveillance   -   Cit
technology   -   Cit
such   -   Cit
as   -   Cit

not   -   Cit
only   -   Cit

one
's
privacy
;
it
is
also
not
cost
effective
and
likely
to
result
in
data
theft
and
data
loss
.

however
,
large
scale
setup
of

and

lookalike
safety

might
not
be
feasible
as
they
increases   increase   SVA

they

do

or

.

however
,
there
are
arguments
that
are
against
the   makes   SVA
use
of

technology
in
monitoring
and
tracking
people
and

despite
the

thus
,

to

as
it
can
prevent

.

just
what
is
surveillance
technology
?

so
,   prove   Vt
my
stand
as
a
reviewer
is
that
tata
's
nano
lacks
safety
.

on
the
contrary
,
excessive
public
spending
can
also
-   a   ArtOrDet
hinder
the
development
of
a
country
too
.

this
could   can   Vt
be
explained
because
in
order
to
determine
the
most
possible
solution
in
engineering
design
process
,
we
have
to
conduct
many
experiments
and
these
experiments
require
materials
in   for   Wci
which
money
must
be
injected
into
the
project
.

their
efforts
should
be
compensated
when
they
are
old
by
providing
-   them with a   Wci
suitable
assistance
scheme
through
public
spending

tracing
back
to
the   with   Prep
late
1970s
,
electronic
data
interchange
and
electronic
funds
transfer
first
emerged
in
the
us
to
satisfy
people
's
needs
for
simple
business
communication
.

defining
it
would
include
a
refining
of
the
question
at
hand
to
a
more
straight
forward
one
.

if
we
fail
to
limit
the   -   ArtOrDet
public
spending
on
the
aged
,
the
pressure
is
likely
to
have
an
effect
on
public
spending
for
other
priorities
,
and
also
affect
economic
growth
.

there
are
other
contributing
factors
such
as
the
efforts
of
the
inventors
and
their
determinations   determination   SVA
to
succeed
that
lead   leads   Vt
to
the
discovery
of
the
technology
.

in
all   sum   Trans
,
with
the
help
of
advancing   advanced   Wform
technologies
,
the
elderly
can
counter
their
shortfalls   -   Rloc-
in   -   Rloc-

thus   -   Rloc-

there   -   Rloc-

nobody   -   Rloc-
at   -   Rloc-

for
example
,
when
somebody
or
some
companies
want
to
apply
new
techniques
into
practice
,
in
some
certain
situations
,
they
had   have   Vt

to

,
with
the

made

it

compared
to

,
-   the   ArtOrDet
electric

has
a

different
components
.

the
above
mentioned   that occured   Pref
facts
state
that
the

are

thus
,
through

research
-   the   Mec
cost
of

can
be
reduced
and
the

technology
can
be
enhanced
to

minimize

and
to
avoid

however

it

therefore

the

the

but
also

this
issue
has
led

in
recent
time   times   Wci
,
terrorists
have
accessed   access   Wform
to
sophisticated
technologies
that
could
create
greater
destruction
to
the
surrounding   surroundings   Wci
and
-   are able   V0
to
instil
fear
in
the
people
.

there
are
some
current
solutions
available
such
as
;   -   Mec
primary
regulations
,
control

,   and   Others
increased
fuel
efficiency

although
we

not

also   has also been   Vt
suggested

may
create
an
emotional
impact
,
especially
when
disclosed
despite
the
patient
-   's   Npos
reluctance

however
,
this
argument
ignores   disregards   Wci
the
fact
that
terrorism
will
be
around
regardless
of
whether
nuclear
plants
are
built
or
not
.

therefore
we
can
see
those   that   Ssub
students
are
only
encouraged
to
greater   -   Rloc-
explore
and
express
their
creativity
during
their
tertiary
years
of
studies
.

take
china
as
-   an   Wci
example
;   ,   Mec
there
are
two
main
problems
in   -   Prep
hampering
the
development
of
innovation
.

according
to
rogers
(
2003   are   Vt
)
,
skunkwork
refers
to
a
small
group
of
highly
selected
people
designated
to
do
research
for
an
innovation
without
carry
out
tedious
organization
procedures
.

this
issue
particularly
affects
innovations
that
are
on
the   a   ArtOrDet
larger
scale
,
as
large
cost   costs   Nn
will
be
incurred
in
the
construction
of
its   their   Pref
foundations
.

because
engineering   engineering   Mec
designs
are
always
related
to
real
problem   problems   Nn
,
during
the
five
processes
,
the
obstacles
they
face
are
more
than
theories
and
calculations
on
paper
.

in
2000-2001
,
seniors
accounted
for
43
percent
of
total
health
care
spending
but
represented
only
12.5
percent
of
the
population
.

it
is
highly
notable
that
since
chenobyl
incident
there
is   has been   Vt
no
more
any   -   ArtOrDet
accident
.

therefore
,
it
is
necessary   assets   Nn
for
the
government
to
review
the
public
policies
for
the
elderly
.

after
the
accident
,
people
tried
to
figure   analyse   Wtone
out   analyse   Wtone
what
are   were   Vt
the
reasons
that
caused
the
malfunction   malfunctioning   Wform
of
the
power

it
is
because
rfid
is
able
to
efficiently
detect
terrorists
and
criminals
who
hide
drugs
in
their
bodies
,
all
objects
made
by   of   Prep

however

brought
about

for

older

tend

work

save
less
and
also
require
more
health   -   Wform

in
addition
,
encouraging
later

proved
to
ease
the

process

to
be
more
accurate
,
in

main

the

however
,
once
the

nuclear

in

if

they

of

in
such

generally
,
the
engineering
design
process
consists
mainly
of
the
five
procedures
mentioned
by

(

which
includes

the

the
approaches

the
prolonging

however
-   ,   Mec
since
the
benefits
reaped
from
surveillance

overpowers   outweigh   Wci
the
inconvenience
it
results
in
,
surveillance
technology
should
indeed
be
used
to
track
people
.

since
the
prime
minister
had
already
envisaged
a
need
to
create
a
better
living
environment
for
singaporeans
,
so   -   Rloc-
why
not
we
lessen   reduce   Wci
the
spending
on
the
aged
and
invest
it
on
realising
this
wonderful
concept
?

in
the
past
,
it
is   was   Vt
used
to
track
equipments   equipmentequipment   Nn
and
data
and
this
does   did   Vt
not
create
much
controversy
in   with regard to   Wci
the
issue
of
privacy
.

the
elderly
in
singapore
are
dependent
on
government
subsidies
in
various
areas
due
to
high
cost
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
living
in
present
society
.

this
is
due
to
its
ability
of   to operate   Vform

at
higher
pressure
and
temperature
(
at
550
degree

)
with   in   Prep
a

operation
,
unlike
the
current
lwrs
that
need
recirculation
of
heat
and
components
like
jet
pumps
and
steam
generators
.

by
living
a
healthier
life
,
the
elderly
people
can
live
their
days
more
normally
and
hence
-   this will   SVA
help
them
to   in   Wci
ease   in   Wci
the
aging
process
.

therefore
,
it
is
not
true
to
say
that
the   -   ArtOrDet
working
adults
bear
a
heavier
burden
from
supporting
their
parents
when   because   Trans
government
incentives
are
provided
.

an   In an   Others

while
the
idea

to
ease

problem
in

is
workable
,
there

be

however
,
these
aesthetic

are
costly
and
usually
not
subsidised
by
the
government
.

as
the   -   ArtOrDet
living
conditions
improve
and
technology
advances
,
people
are
able
to
lead
a
healthier
lifestyle
and
live
longer
as
compared
to
the

the

another
impact
is
the
sustainability
of

it

its

and
to

if

we

obviously

quite

as

therefore
the

therefore

in

thus
it

to

with

with

such

most

therefore
it

since

therefore
-   ,   Mec
to
make

there
is
a

this

moreover
,
the
rate

kept

will

as
wilpert
(
2007   experience   Nn
)
states
,
safety
of
engineering
design
depends
on
three
things
,
namely
,
effective
process
,
production
control
and
failure
avoidance
.

radioactive

allows

to
get
consultation
from

money
should
be
spent
on

growing

economy
so
that

can
have
larger
income
to
tap

the
penicillium

most
of
the

do
not

needed
in
today

society
in

from
the
above
examples
in
different

,
it
is
inevitable
to
conclude
that
elderly
employment
is
one
of
the
policies
that
have   has   SVA
been
well
adopted
by
various
governments

finally

since
genetic
testing
is
beneficial
,
some
governments
have
come
up
with
legal
procedures
that
would
protect
suffers   attached   Vform
from
genetic
discrimination
.

maybe
it
was
just
because
that   -   Rloc-
fleming
discovered
the   -   ArtOrDet
penicillin
by
chance
,
he
did
not
experience
any
failure
during

,
while
the

did

the

apparently

the

of

in

due

that

singapore

some

in

therefore

the

but
vhtrs

on

due
to
the

and

it

however
,
it
is
not
ethical
to
pass

their
defective

their   from having   Wci

in
order
to
fulfill
the
dream
of

furthermore
,
this
report
also
stated
that
rfid
tags
could
promote
the
frequent
access
for
the
patient
to
their
medical
information
and
increase
the
continuity
and
coordination
of

which
resulting   -   Rloc-
reduction   reduces   Vform

.

and
when
they
have
-   the   ArtOrDet
ideas
-   on   Wci
how
to
solve
this
problem
,
they
need
to
ensure

they
select
the

in

been
revamping

constantly
to

hopefully

thirdly
,
there

despite

if   However , if   Trans

it   -   Rloc-

would

the
younger

may
find
it

to

.

however
,
in
terms
of
process
and
effort
,
the
research
to
develop   -   Rloc-
new

is
different
from
the
serendipitous

hence
,
the

be

currently

the

some
of
the
most
well-known
strategies
for
dealing
with
the

are
extending

,
lengthening

and
encouraging

psychology
is
useful

thus
it
is
easier
to
come

with

solution
that
will
reduce

however

however
,
the

had
broken
many
important
rules
of

just
to
complete

quickly
:
they
had
diminished
the

disabled

released
the

this

this

whichever

it

so
it
is
important

vhtr
is   was   Vt
initially
designed
to
use
helium
as
its
coolant
which
is
not
the
most
suitable
for
an
instant
passive
heat
removal
system
.

from
-   the   ArtOrDet
analysis
,
the
vhtr
will
spend
fuel
in
a
symbiotic
fuel
cycle
that
can
achieve
significant
reductions
in
waste
quantity
and
radio
toxicity
because
of
its
ability
to
accommodate
a
wide
variety
-   of   Wci
mixture
of
fissile
and
fertile
materials
without
significantly
modification
of
the
core
design
(
u.s.
department
of
energy
nuclear
,
2002
)
.

however
,
due
to
the
plant
simplification
,
its
design
is
far   -   Um
simpler
,
that
is
,
without
the
circulation
pumps
,
pressurizers
,
steam
generators
and
dryers
.

considering
the
above
three
concerns
:   -- safety   Mec
safety   -- safety   Mec
,
cost   cost   Mec
and
performance   performance   Mec
,
the
generation
iv
international
forum
,
formed
by
ten
countries
,
puts
forward
six
outstanding
protocols
into
research
and
development
.

according
to
the
accident
investigation
report
(
ministry
of
manpower
,
2005
)
,
it
was
found
that
the
main
cause
of
the
collapse
was
due
to
underdesign   under-designing   Wform
of
the
retaining
wall
which
could
not
handle
the
stress
of
holding
up
the
tunnel
.

one
popular
example
is
penicillin
,
where   which   Ssub
it   which   Ssub
turned
out
to
be
the
first
antibiotic
because
of
its
property
of
killing
biological
materials
when
it
was
left
in
petri
dishes
containing
biological
organisms
.

however
,
the
withdrawal
of
governmental
support   -   Rloc-
in   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
health   -   Rloc-
care   -   Rloc-
for   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
aged   -   Rloc-
would
shift
the
responsibility
to
the
families
of
these
aged
and
burden
the
development
of
the
country
in
the
long
run
.

therefore
,
this
has
increased
the
significance
of
-   the   ArtOrDet
cpf
as
it
compels
people
to
save
in
advance
lest
they
are
unable
or   -   Rloc-
have   -   Rloc-
no   -   Rloc-
one   -   Rloc-
to
support
them   themselves   Pref
during
their
old
age
.

therefore
-   ,   Mec
most
of   Chinese   Wform
china   Chinese   Wform
enterprisers   entrepreneurs   Wform
focus
on
short-run
product   products   Nn
and
expect
instant
profit
.

subsequently
,
the
inventor
of
the
very   -   Rloc-
software
can
only
get
a
little
profit
,
which
will
not
impel
him
or
her
to
continue
paying
much
attention
to
the   -   ArtOrDet
innovation
.

a
country
that
is
not
expanding
as
fast
as
the
population
grows
will
bring   -   Um
forward   -   Um
insufficient
housing
for
its
people
.

in
consideration
of
these
factors
,
designers
have
conceived
the
3-d
printer
,
which
is
capable
of
speeding
up
designing
process   processes   Nn
.

nevertheless
,
the
aging
process
is
commonly   -   Rloc-
viewed   -   Rloc-
as   -   Rloc-
an
unavoidable
,
undesirable
,
problem-ridden
phrase
of
life
that
we
are
required
to
go
through
it   -   Rloc-
.

people
are
afraid
of   that   Wci
gm
plants
may
break
the
balances   balance   Nn
in
the   -   ArtOrDet
nature
.

because
of
the
staff
's
breach
of
duty
,
the
operators
detected
the
reactors
'
problem
very
late
and
-   a   ArtOrDet
even
took
erroneous
actions
.

besides
,
lots   -   Rloc-
public
spending
will
be
required
for
modifications
works
in
neighbourhood
estates
-   ,   Srun
such
as
-   the   ArtOrDet
building
-   of   Prep
more
railings
and
slopes
with
anti-slipped
layer
(
tong
,
2007
)
.

importantly   Important   Wform
as
it
is
,
very
few
old
people
managed   will   Vt
to   will   Vt
get
back
to
school
and
receive
education
again
.

besides
,
public
policies
that
encourage
and
facilitate
education
,
basic
research
,
and
the
application
of
promising
technologies
can
enhance
the
well-being
of
current
and
future
generations
of
older
people
(
robert
b.
friedland
and
laura
summer,2005
)
.in
other
words
,
elites
are
able
to
invent
more
advanced
technology
in   to   Wci
term   to   Wci
of   to   Wci
accelerate
nation   nationational   Wform
development
.

however
,
although
the   -   ArtOrDet
spending
on
the
aged
is
high
,
it
should
not
be
limited
.

meanwhile
,
helium
is
radioactive
when
it
is
radiated
,
unlike
the   -   ArtOrDet
other
coolants
.

therefore
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
current
development   developments   Nn
,
research   researches   Nn
and
policies
implemented   are implemented   Vt
are   are implemented   Vt
meant   are implemented   Vt
to
ease
the
aging
process
-   ,   Mec
and
they
are
highly
effective
.

today
,
one
of
the
main
concerns
about
human
need
is
the
innovation
of
a
more
environmental-friendly   environmentally-friendly   Vt
vehicle
.

in
conclusion
,
surveillance
technology
should
be
banned
for   to a certain extent   Wci
certain   to a certain extent   Wci
degree   to a certain extent   Wci
to
ensure
that
privacy
is
protected
and
the
security
issue
is
solved
also   too   Wci
.

for
elderlies   elderly   Vt
with
both
presbyopia
and
myopia
or
both
presbyopia
and
hyperopia
,
recent
improvements
in
lens
optics
has   have   SVA
created   resulted in the creation of   Wci
bifocals
lens
(
convex
and
concave
lens
combined
into
a
single
lens
)
to   , which   Srun
allow
the
elderly
to
have
both
their
presbyopia
and
myopia
or
both
their
presbyopia
and
hyperopia
to   -   Rloc-
be   -   Rloc-
corrected
.

therefore
,
the
adult
children
of
the
aged
seem
like
the
most
plausible
individuals
to
depend   provide   Wci
on   provide   Wci
by   provide   Wci
providing   provide   Wci
for
their
parents
.

several
problems
which
relate
to
the
issue
include
health   health , financial and welfare problems   Others
,   health , financial and welfare problems   Others

welfare   health , financial and welfare problems   Others
of
the
elderly
has   have   SVA
come
under
the
concern
of
the
government
.

in
this
example
,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
original
design
work
,
but
the
design
still
can
not
be
carried
out
due
to
political
inconsistent   inconsistency   Wform
between
the
city
government
and
higher
level
authorities
.

however
,
they
should
take
in   into   Prep
consideration
-   the fact   Wci
that
there
are
elderly
from
the
past
generations
without
good
education
who
have
not
been
able
to
save
in
their
younger
days
.

for
example
,
the
carbon-fibre
reinforced
carbon
can
bear
the
highest
temperature
which
the
vhtr
could
generate
.

there
are
cars
designed
for
easy   -   Rloc-
entry   -   Rloc-
for   -   Rloc-
the
wheelchair-bound
or
those
with
difficulty
walking
,
like
-   the   ArtOrDet
toyota
motor
corp.
's
welcab
series
.

conversely
,
if
the
country
is   were   Vt
not
knowledge   knowledge-   Mec
based
,
it
can   could   Vm
hardly
make
any
economic
progress
-   ,   Srun
due
to
the
lack
of
understanding
of
technology
-   in   Wci
development
thus   . Thus , this may   Srun
leading   lead   Rloc-
to
shortages
in
the
government
's
annual
budget
for
the
aged
.

moreover
,
lfr
has
a
comparative   -   Rloc-
safety
advantage
compared
to
the
other
nuclear
reactors
designs
.

such
policies
include
social
policy
like
increasing
the
retirement
age
,
allowing
more
work   employable   Wci
age   employable   Wci
immigrants
into
the
country
and
introducing
retirement
scheme   schemes   Wform
to
ease
basic
needs
after
retirement
.

adding
on
to
the
misery
,
the
cost
associated
with
healthcare
is
also
growing
with
the
combined
effect
of
-   a   ArtOrDet
rising
standard
of
living
and
-   the   Vt
high
cost
of
advanced
medical
development
.

the
elderly
can
be
stronger
and
less   fewer   Wci
of
them
will
be
suffering
from
physical   medical conditions   Wci
illnesses   medical conditions   Wci
,
such
as
stroke
,
diabetes
,
cancer
and
high
blood
pressure
.

in
addition
,
msr   MSRs   Trans
uses   use   SVA
liquid
fuel
as
compared
to
the
other
reactors
that
use
solid
fuel
.

as   -   Prep
in   In   Mec
terms
of
all
the
policies
and
development   developments   Nn
mentioned
above
,
especially
about   -   Prep
the
workfare
scheme
,
the
government
should
increase
the
net
payout
amount
(
cash
)
and
reduce
the
percentage
contributing
to
the
cpf
.

a
600   give   Wci
mwth
vhtr
dedicated
to
hydrogen
production
can
yield
over
2
million
normal
cubic
meters
per
day
.

besides
,
medisave
can
be
easily
drained
especially
on
chronic
illnesses
,   means   Wform
which
can
tote
up
to
a
huge
amount
.

some
governments
even
do
it
``
too
''
well
that
a
large
amount   -   Rloc-
of   -   Rloc-
money   -   Rloc-
,   -   Rloc-
which
should
be
spent
on
other
social
issues
,
is
wasted
.

the
consequences
of
-   an   ArtOrDet
population
aging
are
presenting
both
opportunities
and
challenges
for
all
nations
.

therefore
,
with   -   Vt
the   -   Vt
advancing   -   Vt
technologies   -   Vt
,   -   Vt
it   not   Wci
does   not   Wci
not   not   Wci
mean   not   Wci
that   not   Wci
every
product
that
was   is being   Vt
invented
would
help
the
elderly
to   -   Rloc-
ease   -   Rloc-
into   in   Prep
the
aging
process
.

first   Firstly   Wform
,
the   -   ArtOrDet
current
government
policies
are
not
easing
the
ageing
process
because
they
are
limited
to
a
specified
group
of
the
aged
population
.

nevertheless
,
singapore
is
planning
to
increase
their   its   Pform
spending
to
6.8
billion
euros
by
2010
and
target   targets   SVA
to
spend
3
%
of
their
gdp
(
gafoor
,
2008
)
.

also
,
the
government
can
direct
more
technological
resources
to
school   schools   Nn
so
as
to
better
equip
the
younger
generation
in   for a   Trans
the   for a   Trans
technological-edged
world
,
improving
their
economical
worth
.

tiles
or
pavements
with
better
friction
have
been
placed
in
toilets
to
prevent
-   the   ArtOrDet
elderly
from
slipping
.

applicants
for
insurance   a   ArtOrDet
will
be
under
increased
pressure
to
undergo
genetic
tests
and
those
prone
to
diseases
are
less
likely
to
be
eligible
to
buy
insurance
.

besides
,
the
aged
may
also
choose
to
carry
a
portable
digital
magnifier
which
takes
-   a   ArtOrDet
picture
behind
the
device
,
magnifies
it
to
-   a   ArtOrDet
desired
clearness
and
show   shows   Wform
it
on
the
screen
such
as
pocketviewer
.

different
countries
also   have since   Vt
promulgated
different
regulations
to
limit
the
use
of
the
camera
phone
.

furthermore
,
parents
would
resort
in   to   Prep
using
webcams
and
gps
systems
to
check
on
their
children
'
activities
(
ball
,
k.
&   -   Cit
et
al
.

the
aged
are
advised
to
solve
their
problems
as
possible   possibly   Wform
as
they
can
and
put
the   -   ArtOrDet
public
support
as
their
second
choice
.

it
is
more
ideal
if
a
win-win
situation
could
be
established
,
as
this
will
also
give
a
good
reflection   -   Rloc-
on   -   Rloc-
the   -   Rloc-
country   -   Rloc-
's   -   Rloc-
overall   -   Rloc-
progress
,
both
internally
and
externally
.

obviously
,
efforts
that
the
government
put
in   into   Prep
developing
the
economics   economy   Wform
of
our
country
have
resulted
-   in   Others
a
successfully
growth
and
inevitably
,
this
has
contributed
in
easing
and
solving
the
problems
of
aging
population
.
